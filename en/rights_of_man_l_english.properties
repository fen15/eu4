coptic_flavor.11.t코0=Monastery of Saint Anthony
coptic_flavor.11.d코0=Deep in the Red Sea mountains, in a hidden oasis, lies one of our most sacred places – the Monastery of Saint Anthony. Built by Anthony's followers in the 4th century, this Christian monastery is one of the oldest in the world. Saint Anthony, foremost of the Desert Fathers, is known as The Father of Monks. He ventured into the desert where he spent many years as a hermit, his life dedicated to God. During the Great Persecution he went back to civilization to comfort the imprisoned, risking his life for his fellow Christians. At the end of his life he settled by the oasis where the great monastery stands today.

coptic_flavor.13.d코0=At the foot of the holy Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments, stands a monastery dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Catherine was a devoted student and follower of Christ. When the Roman Emperor Maxentius began persecuting Christians, the brave young maiden reproached him for his cruelty. The emperor gathered fifty of his best philosophers and orators to debate with her, but wise Catherine won. Even though she was subsequently imprisoned and tortured, Maxentius failed yet again as many of his closest subjects were converted by Catherine's eloquence and piousness. In his fury, the emperor sentenced Catherine to death on a breaking wheel, but it shattered at her touch. In the end she was beheaded, although her martyrdom has helped spread the light of Christ to many godless hearts.

coptic_flavor.20.t코0=The Importance of Higher Learning
coptic_flavor.20.d코0=The monasteries of our [Root.GovernmentName] are famed as centers of learning and art. At each monastic school reside a number of religious scholars, experts within fields such as church history, exegesis of the Holy Scripture, reading, grammar, poetry, music, calligraphy and painting. The monasteries compete to attract the most learned masters and maintain them with great honor and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support. If we choose to offer our patronage, it could be beneficial for the scholarly development of the nation.

coptic_flavor.28.t코0=The Birth of the Church
coptic_flavor.28.d코0=Today, fifty days after Easter, we observe Pentecost. On this sacred day, many centuries ago, our Church was born. The Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the other followers of Christ as tongues of fire. Thus they spoke the word of the Lord in all the world's languages and converted thousands of souls to the true faith. Hereby began a new era, the messianic age of the Kingdom of God. In memory of this great event we hold one of the Church's largest celebrations. Together we read from the Bible, sing joyous hymns and kneel in prayer.
coptic_flavor.29.t코0=Feast of Palm Sunday
coptic_flavor.29.d코0=As Copts we celebrate Palm Sunday which is one of the Seven Major Lord's Feasts. On the seventh Sunday of the Great Lent we commemorate and relive Jesus' triumphal entry into the holy city of Jerusalem. It is on this day that He drove away the merchants and moneychangers from the Temple. The crowd who cheeringly greeted the Messiah were waving palm branches over their heads and so do we as we make our way through the church on this happy day. During the procession we chant the joyful hymns and it is truly one of our favorite times during the Church year.

coptic_flavor.30.t코0=In Search of the Soul
coptic_flavor.30.d코0=A few religious conversations here, some impressive arguments about morality of man there, and one of our most learned noblemen has decided to take up a monastic life. 'I shall follow in the footsteps of Saint Shenoute the Archimandrite – one day I might even found a monastery of my own!' he exclaims passionately.\nNot everyone would agree with the nobleman's decision, however, and even though he has already started giving away his belongings, there might still be time to talk the man out of going.
coptic_flavor.30.a코0=We could use that passion in some of our provinces...
coptic_flavor.30.a.tt코0=The nobleman becomes a missionary, a sacred duty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] beyond that of a monk.

coptic_flavor.31.d코0=The province of Quina has sent representatives to request resources and support in the restoration of a famous old monastery said to have been the home of Saint Schenoute the Archimandrite himself. The foundations of the stone walls were set over a millennium ago and the devout worshipers in the area long for nothing more than to restore the building to its former glory. 'With your aid, it will once again become a center of higher learning and scripture studies' they assure us.
coptic_flavor.31.a코0=Let them have their books!

coptic_flavor.32.d코0=We have received word from [pious_province.GetName] of a group of commoners gathering in the countryside at regular intervals - it appears they are worshipers of the Lord. According to our couriers they have attempted to build a place of worship for some time now, but increased funds would likely speed the project along.

coptic_flavor.40.d코0=The Coptic religion has long had a presence in [cairo_province.GetName]. Some of the Patriarch's followers abroad have even claimed that we are keeping Copts captive in our lands... Perhaps they need a reminder of the situation?

coptic_flavor.41.d코0=Our neighbors in [From.GetName] have sent messages to our realm, informing us of the current status of the blessed Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName].

coptic_flavor.42.t코0=The Patriarch Captive
coptic_flavor.42.d코0=Our neighbors in [From.GetName] have sent messages to our realm, reminding us that they hold our blessed Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName]. While His Holiness is still alive, we can't be certain of the level of religious tolerance displayed by [From.GetAdjective] rule.
coptic_flavor.42.a코0=This won't stand! A veiled threat is still a threat!
coptic_flavor.42.a.tt코0=We let them know of our sentiments.
coptic_flavor.42.b코0=We shouldn't let them rile us.
coptic_flavor.42.b.tt코0=We let it slide for now.
coptic_flavor.43.t코0=The Copts Respond
coptic_flavor.43.da코0=The [From.GetAdjective] Copts are pleased by our messages of kind-hearted spirit! Perhaps our people will live harmoniously for centuries to come?

coptic_flavor.43.a.tt코0=This might be the start of a beautiful friendship - both countries receive §YApproves of Diplomacy§! - opinion of one another changed by §G+25§!.
coptic_flavor.43.db코0=The paranoid [From.GetAdjective] are insulted by our messages, calling it a thinly veiled threat against their Patriarch. Their response contained an ungodly amount of curses aimed at us. Perhaps this was a mistake?
coptic_flavor.43.b코0=It's not our fault.
coptic_flavor.43.dc코0=The [From.GetAdjective] are insulted by our thinly veiled threat against their Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName]. The response from their rulers contains a belligerent warning of touching the hair of a single Copt.
coptic_flavor.43.c코0=We expected as much.
coptic_flavor.43.dd코0=The [From.GetAdjective] have sent no messages in response to our thinly veiled threats against their Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName]. Either they do not care about their holy site, or they are too scared of the glorious [Root.GetName] to speak against us.

coptic_flavor.33.t코0=Allies of the Faith
coptic_flavor.33.d코0=We are proud to be Copts, followers of the true faith. While we are firm in our convictions and will never abandon Christ, being isolated from the rest of the Christian community is a weakness. We are beset by religious enemies on many fronts. The impending war is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. Before it breaks out we should try to seek out some powerful allies. There is a mighty Christian realm far to the north, but its exact location and the distance to their lands are unknown to us. However we can fund an expedition with the goal of finding them.
coptic_flavor.33.a코0=Send a party of our best explorers, priests and diplomats!
coptic_flavor.33.a.tt코0=Send an expedition to the north in search of fellow Christians. Success is not guaranteed, but we could find some sort of assistance regarding our common religious enemies.

coptic_flavor.33.b.tt코0=No expedition is sent.
coptic_flavor.34.t코0=Books or Swords
coptic_flavor.34.d코0=A party of Coptic diplomats from our neighbor [From.GetName] have crossed into our territory. They have an unusually large number of priests among them. Our advisors suspect that they are trying to make contact with other Christians to the north. The diplomats are worryingly tight-lipped on the subject of their purpose. Perhaps it is simply a religious matter, but what if they are attempting to gather allies against us? We would be beset on multiple fronts by fanatical infidels!
coptic_flavor.34.a코0=These are just speculations. The [From.GetAdjective] diplomats may pass.
coptic_flavor.34.b코0=We cannot take the risk. Detain them.
coptic_flavor.35.t코0=Enemy of the Faith
coptic_flavor.35.d코0=News has reached us that our despicable neighbors, the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName], have taken our diplomats captive! They will neither be persuaded to let our people continue on their journey or return back home. We can only hope that they change their minds. In any case, this outrageous attack on a party of peaceful envoys only confirms our suspicions. [From.GetName] is a dangerous enemy of the one true faith.
coptic_flavor.35.a코0=May God smite the infidels!
coptic_flavor.36.t코0=Brothers From Across the Sea
coptic_flavor.36.d코0=Sometimes we are reminded of how far this world extends beyond our own realms. We have been visited by a strange group of people from lands far south from here. While most of them only speak their own peculiar-sounding language, a few of them have conversed with our translators in Arabic. They claim to come from the great [sent_diplomats.GovernmentName] of [sent_diplomats.GetName] and that they seek friends among their fellow Christians. We have very little knowledge of the Christians in the south, but these [sent_diplomats.GetAdjective] men seem to be genuine believers. They speak of Christ with fervor in their voice and seem far more well-versed in the scripture than our average noble. Apparently their country is surrounded by religious enemies and they ask us to aid them in defending the true faith. While this conflict is too distant and unknown for us to get engaged directly, we could share some of our knowledge and resources with them.
coptic_flavor.36.a코0=Of course we will help you, brothers. Anything for the one true God!
coptic_flavor.36.a.tt코0=The [From.GetAdjective] diplomats are sent home with some resources to aid them in their defense of Christianity.
coptic_flavor.36.b코0=This is not our concern. We have our own wars to fight.
coptic_flavor.36.b.tt코0=The [From.GetAdjective] diplomats are sent home empty-handed.
coptic_flavor.37.t코0=Friends in Foreign Places
coptic_flavor.37.d코0=Praise the Lord, our diplomats have finally returned from their journey to the north! Not only are they with us again, safe and sound, but they also bring many interesting tomes and tales from their travels. Most come from the [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName], where our diplomats were very well received. While we might have hoped for more than knowledge, we are thankful for whatever God and our fellow Christians provides us with. We will make sure that their gift does not go to waste.
coptic_flavor.37.a코0=Perhaps this is the start of a lasting friendship between our nations?
coptic_flavor.38.t코0=Alone in the World
coptic_flavor.38.d코0=After a long and arduous journey the diplomats whom we sent northwards have finally returned. They did indeed reach Christian lands in the end, yet they come back empty-handed. While many of the Christians they encountered listened, few seemed to truly care. In our isolation, we are doubly cursed – not only are we surrounded by enemies, the distance to the rest of the Christian community makes us outcasts. What happens in [Root.GetName] does not influence them and perhaps our ways are too foreign for them to relate to. It seems as if the Copts are alone in the world.

These merchants now compete for favors from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who completed what the crusaders could not and through them we have been able to gain contact with a large number of other Christian states around the Eastern Mediterranean.

HOLY_SITE_1227_DESC코0=In Aksum stands The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion, which was built in the 4th century during the reign of Ezana, the first Christian ruler of the ancient Aksumite empire. According to the legends it is here the great emperor Menelik I, son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, brought the Ark of the Covenant after his journey to Jerusalem.
HOLY_SITE_358_DESC코0=Alexandria is the historical seat of the Coptic Church even though its Patriarch, the Pope of Alexandria, resides in Cairo since the 11th century. While the Pope resided in Alexandria, his seat was Saint Mark's Cathedral, which was built in honor of Mark the Evangelist, founder of the Coptic Church. For millennia Alexandria has been a center of learning and the first catechetical school in the world was founded here.
HOLY_SITE_419_DESC코0=The Etchmiadzin Cathedral in Vagharshapat is said to have been founded by St Gregory the Illuminator and St Tiridates the Great, and despite centuries of foreign occupation it remains one of the most important holy sites of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
HOLY_SITE_2313_DESC코0=Antioch, the Cradle of Christianity, was a center of Christianity during Roman times. It became the seat of one of the five original patriarchates, along with Constantinople, Jerusalem, Alexandria and Rome. Antioch was once a bustling metropolis of half a million souls, but declined as it was ravaged during the Crusades. It fell in the 13th century as the city was razed by Muslims, and its entire Christian population was either enslaved or killed.
HOLY_SITE_1234_DESC코0=The ancient city of Qasr Ibrim became a center of Christianity in the 8th century and reached its prime during the Eparchy of Nobatia. Even as the rest of Makuria became Islamic, the population of Qasr Ibrim remained Christian and has done so until this day. Perched atop a cliff overlooking the River Nile, Qasr Ibrim has become a place of great economic, political and religious importance.

[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was never the most likely of candidates and would likely never have taken the throne if a clear favorite had existed.\nSome would go as far as to say that it was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mediocrity that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to triumph. Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. One thing our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has clearly demonstrated: When the need arises [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not shy away from sinking a dagger in the back of those that trust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

Most of our Viziers feel it is our duty to uphold our dynastic tradition of appointing our sons to act as governors and rulers over small provinces. This way they can learn what it is to be a ruler. By assigning suitably powerful provinces we can also reduce the chance of a future succession struggle. [sancaga_cikma_province.GetName] has served as such a governorship at times in the past and would likely fit [Root.Heir.GetName] very well.\nOthers, including our Mother, the Valide Sultan, feel that young [Root.Heir.GetName] would benefit the most from an education within the walls of the Imperial Harem, where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will have constant access to good teachers and can be supervised by those who know him.

If our favorite did learn something, that is not very apparent to us, however, and in the Harem rumors are circulating that the only way [Root.Heir.GetName] enriched himself was by lining his pocket during the local revenue collection.

[Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] claims these years have taught [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] many things about what it means to be the head of a government and how our provincial system works on the local level. During [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time away from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has had ample time to lead the local troops, oversee the administration and juggle the local strongmen.

harem_events.9.d코0=Like the Sultans of old [Root.Heir.GetName] hopes to make a name for [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] as a conqueror and a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who will lead the Empire from the horseback. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is still in good health, and as we have not allowed our heir to actually take to the field, the realization of this dream remains an uncertainty. It has come to the point that [Root.Heir.GetName] is being ridiculed by the other Sehzade and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother is imploring [Root.Monarch.GetName] to give [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a command of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own.\nThis is not an unreasonable request, though one must wonder about the motives of those that try to goad our favorite to risk [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] life and limb.

Both also control a faction of their own in the Imperial Harem and while they both claim to have the best interests of [Root.Monarch.GetName] at heart a clash of wills have always been inevitable. [Root.Consort.GetName] has been maneuvering to have one of her sons take [Root.Heir.GetName]'s place as heir, but the Valide Sultan will have none of it. Both women have invested considerable prestige in the conflict by now.

harem_events.18.d코0=As many of the Sultan's before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a very close bond with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother. As it please God the Valide Sultan is a powerful ally, friend and confidant for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and to reflect this she has been granted a most generous allowance. Money that apart from being used for her personal needs she has been putting to use for the betterment of the state. Our mother is not content with this, however, and has asked for an even more generous arrangement that would allow her to fund ambitious building projects in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] itself.

harem_events.20.d코0=The Haseki Sultan is not only the favorite consort of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], she is also the mistress of the Imperial Harem and the most powerful woman in the Empire bar the Sultan Mother.

harem_events.21.d코0=As [Root.Monarch.GetName] has yet to name a favorite among his consorts every one of them is maneuvering to take their rightful place alongside the Sultan. The Imperial Harem is rife with intrigue and right now making a well informed choice for the position of Haseki Sultan, one of the highest honors imaginable in the empire would seem all but impossible. Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mother has a firm grip on the politics of the Harem and has presented [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a consort she feels would be a good candidate.

harem_events.22.t코0=[Root.GetName] and the Royal Princes
harem_events.22.d코1=As is customary some of our provinces are governed by imperial princes so that they may learn what it is to be rulers one day. It is also understood that these provinces can serve as their base of power when the time comes to see to the succession. That struggle itself often gives ample opportunity to sort out the bad eggs.\nSometimes, however, the process can be even more hasty. It seems one of our Prince-Governor's has managed to actively destroy the resources under his control. If nothing is done soon revenue will be permanently reduced. Unfortunately, however, the Royal Prince, while not our favorite, does have support from some influential groups in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName], so if we are to withdraw his assignment there will be some backlash.
harem_events.22.a코0=Replace him immediately
harem_events.22.b코0=Find an excuse to call him back eventually.
harem_events.23.t코0=To Play the King
harem_events.23.d코0=As the age of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] advances [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sons grow impatient. Unfounded rumors are regularly circulating of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] failing health and the various factions of the court are aligning with the many would-be heirs among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sons. For one the distance in the supposed line of succession was enough to risk the uncertainty of the rumor mill. In [revolter_prince.GetName] one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s sons has taken up arms against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].
harem_events.23.a코0=Kill them all.
harem_events.24.t코0=[Root.GetName] Prospers
harem_events.24.d코0=The administration of [Root.GetName] was recently turned over to be administrated by one of our imperial princes. What we had not expected is that he would be able to do so much so quickly. The local economy is prospering and the urban centers are attracting more merchants and artisans to settle in them. Revenue seems to have been permanently improved.\nSome would consider this an auspicious sign, perhaps we should elevate this son to be our new favorite?
harem_events.24.a코0=This is just the man we're looking for.
harem_events.24.b코0=Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

fetishist_flavor.1.t코0=The Elders of Yoruba
fetishist_flavor.1.d코0=Our warriors have been intrigued by the people of this region and their deep spirituality - the elders here speak of inner balance, respecting the Earth, and to seek transcendence. A key element in their belief seems to be in the Orishas, which are spirits or manifestations of something akin to divinity, ever present in the daily life of their followers. There is also speak of 'Atunwa', reincarnation within the family, and the ceremonies surrounding the stages of life are held in high reverence.\n\nSome of the lost souls in our armies have begun to meditate and seek comfort in one of the most revered Orisha - 'Yemoja', the Mother of Waters.
fetishist_flavor.1.a코0=Interesting.
fetishist_flavor.2.t코0=The Watchful Pangool
fetishist_flavor.2.d코0=We have come across a people who worship the heavenly god of 'Roog', the Master of the World. They say Roog is the beginning and the end of all things, so sacred that the followers are not even permitted to craft images depicting the omnipresent god. Nor do they speak directly to this Creator in their prayers, or when asking for divine favor. Instead they turn their efforts to ancient spirits called the Pangool, the mediators between worlds. Some of these Pangool are said to be the spirits of a person's ancestors and to be accepted by them when one dies is what allows one to pass into 'Jaaniiw', the nocturnal realm and sacred dwelling of the soul. \n\nSome of our warriors are fascinated by the myths of these people - to make sure they won't end up as lost wanderers between realms they have turned to, as local tradition begs, leaving offerings at the feet of tall trees in honor of the Pangool.
fetishist_flavor.2.a코0=Fascinating!
fetishist_flavor.3.t코0=The Children of the Architect
fetishist_flavor.3.d코0=‘If I call one, I call all', a worshiper can be overheard. They are often found praying by the rivers and streams of the area, the believers in Nyame, the Sky Father. They believe in the soul of animals and plants, in 'Abosom', lesser spirits encircling our plane of existence, and they communicate with their ancestors through ornate ritual.\n\nMost of all, this society appears to consist of a people of strong community. When recounting the deeds of their ancestors they sometimes speak of themselves as one - some of our scholars attribute this oddity to mistranslation, while others argue that these followers see themselves as something larger than one, as part of a common spirit, especially within one's own family. ‘They are like a two-headed crocodile, with one stomach - they do not fight one another for food', our advisors suggest.
fetishist_flavor.3.a코0=Intriguing.

The diviner left [Root.Monarch.GetName] confused however, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was told that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heir [Root.Heir.GetName] somehow will bring [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] a premature death. A battle? Poison? An accident? \n\n'Which will it be?' the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] demanded to know, but the signs were not clear - dealing with the matter is now a choice of the utmost delicacy.

The letter sent to us describes how a bandit ambush fell upon the entourage of the traveling statesmen and how they were all forced off a cliff on their way home from a visit in [nonchalant_neighbor.Capital.GetCapitalName], in our neighboring nation of [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName]. The few possessions that could be retrieved have been sent to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is distraught by the death of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favorite relative. To make matters worse, the letter from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] says nothing about whether a proper funeral ceremony has been considered or not.\n\nDo they wish us ill with this Oku igbe, a bush death, for the kin of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?

fetishist_flavor.6.t코0=The Anger of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]
fetishist_flavor.6.d.a코0=We have received a belligerent letter from our neighboring nation of [From.GetName], apparently in response to some of our diplomats informing the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of a tragic bandit attack involving [From.GetAdjective] statesmen. It would seem that one of the victims of the calamity was a relative of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] is outraged that the information relayed neglected any mention of the sacred rites to be issued for [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] kin.\n\nThe worship of [From.GetCult] requires more than our ambassadors assumed.
fetishist_flavor.6.d.b코0=Our neighbors in [From.GetName] have sent us a hostile warning in response to some information we relayed to them recently regarding a bandit attack on some [From.GetAdjective] statesmen. The root of the ill feelings appears to stem from something about funeral rites not being properly performed, or possibly the retrieval of the bodies not being seen to? It's hard to tell from the messy jumble of insults that makes up the letter. The worship of [From.GetCult] is apparently rather complicated...?
fetishist_flavor.6.a코0=It is of no concern to us.
fetishist_flavor.6.a.tt코0=Fellow children of [From.GetCult] or not, we can't be bothered with every small thing in this world.

fetishist_flavor.7.d.a코0=[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been more at peace since the funeral of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cousin was seen to. The ceremony was even attended by diplomats from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName]. Relieved by the knowledge that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] relative is safe in the arms of the Goddess Yemoja, the songs still echo in the mind of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\n‘But when you see a Kob antelope on the way to the farm,\nWhen you see the Kob antelope on the way to the river –\nLeave your arrows in the quiver,\nAnd let the dead depart in peace.'

'Then we are still together', [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, before drifting off to sleep.

fetishist_flavor.8.t코0=The Sons of Nyame
fetishist_flavor.8.d.a코0=The people of [tormented_province.GetName] find themselves in a state of confusion after one of their most valued members of society has fallen ill. Confined to her bed, one influential village elder has not stirred from slumber in over a week. Our advisors suggest that we encourage the locals to prayer, but to whom should the lost souls be turning to? On the one hand we have Tano, the river god and son of Nyame, said to race to your side against Death in the final hours of your life. On the other hand, Anansi the Trickster could perhaps be convinced to lend his aid as well, in exchange for something valuable?
fetishist_flavor.8.a코0=They should turn to Tano, the river deity.
fetishist_flavor.8.a.tt코0=There is no guarantee that praying will have any effect.\n
fetishist_flavor.8.b코0=They should turn to Anansi the Trickster.

fetishist_flavor.9.t코0=The Slithering Pangool
fetishist_flavor.9.d코0=A rumor from [heathen_province.GetName] tells of a giant snake moving into a tree, right in the middle of a village square. While the locals were alarmed at first, the animal has made no attempt to hurt anyone, and has instead gained some social status among the inhabitants, who have begun calling it by pet names... Finally, a wise woman from the area has declared the snake sacred, saying the creature is for certain a spirit taken serpent form, which has encouraged people to bring it sacrifice and food.

fetishist_flavor.101.t코0=The Cwezi Heroes of Kitara
fetishist_flavor.101.d코0=There was a time when the Cwezi ruled these lands, as their Empire, Kitara, encompassed all that is known to men. In our travels we have come across an increasing number of peoples that claim to be the heirs of Kitara cherishing these heroes of old. The spirits still exist in the world around us, in nature and in our minds and some can communicate with the Cwezi through oracles and diviners. In their lands we have come across groups of wandering priestesses who have the power to channel these spirits and through them disease, infertility and misfortune can be mitigated. There are those who devote their entire lives to these lost ancestors and their sanctuaries. All worldly authority must flow from ties to the past and no one can be fit to rule without a direct link to the Cwezi spirits.
fetishist_flavor.101.a코0=Interesting.
fetishist_flavor.102.t코0=The Cult of Mlira
fetishist_flavor.102.d코0=We have come across a people that venerate and worship their own ancestors as gods. Through powerful oracles they can constantly keep in touch with their predecessors and by ensuring their graves and shrines are in good order they can be ensured the ancestors themselves have the power to carry on protecting them.

Mwari lit the fires known to men and Mwari causes the rain to fall. Mwari is the father and the mother of humankind and will guard us in adversity.'\nWe have come across an increasing number of followers of Mwari recently. They all have in common that they refuse to acknowledge any other spiritual power than their one god and while they speak freely and gladly of his existence they guard the secrets of the cult itself carefully.

fetishist_flavor.130.d코0=The Royal Oracle has come bearing good news. After completing the grand ceremonial dance required to contact our most revered ancestors to consult them about the coming year it seems we are in for a bright future. Details are hard to come by through the shroud of death but this can only mean good things.

fetishist_flavor.131.t코0=Caring for Those That Came Before Us
fetishist_flavor.131.d코0=The care of our ancestral shrines remains a constant challenge to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It has been suggested that the best way to handle this would be to appoint one of our most loyal ministers to be the permanent care-taker of the shrines, with an associated budget. As long as our finances could support it this would have few drawbacks, at least as long as we have someone we can trust to do it...
fetishist_flavor.131.a코0=I know just the right person for this!
fetishist_flavor.131.b코0=I wouldn't trust anyone but myself.
ancestral_shrine_caretaker코0=Caretaker of the Ancestral Shrines
desc_ancestral_shrine_caretaker코0=We have employed a group of permanent bureaucrats to oversee the care of our ancestral shrines. These officials are primarily in charge of the day-to-day affairs of keeping the shrines themselves but to a certain extent they are also expected by some to speak for our ancestors.
fetishist_flavor.132.t코0=Ruler Questioned
fetishist_flavor.132.d코0=Appointing someone to be the head of our ancestral shrines has generally been a successful move. The shrines themselves are in good order and our official has also become so closely associated with these spirits that he has been able to create a new set of ceremonies for their worship, in close cooperation with the oracles. Indeed he is now expected to speak for them himself in some regards.\nHowever, it seems our care-taker has started to value his loyalty to the ancestors above that to his [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. He has lately been lobbying for an increase in the budget to keep our holy shrines. It is hard to see a reason to go against the ancestors on this but it is unfortunate that someone feels he can speak for them against us...
fetishist_flavor.132.a코0=Agree to increase the shrine budget.
fetishist_flavor.132.b코0=It's time we take the power over our ancestors back!
fetishist_flavor.133.t코0=Favor of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$
fetishist_flavor.133.d코0=Sometimes the deeds performed in a lifetime are of such caliber that everyone can see what awaits. Diviners agree that $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ was of such high caliber that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is an insufficient title and that we should rather speak of a god or deity. Our people speak of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ with veneration and have already begun to worship their lost [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those who channel this spirit.
fetishist_flavor.133.a코0=Praise be $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$!
fetishist_flavor.150.t코0=Mwari, the one god
fetishist_flavor.150.d코0=While we have accepted the nature of Mwari as our sole creator and the origin of all power it seems not all of our subjects are as convinced of his greatness. In [Root.GetName] widespread veneration of their own ancient local spirits has become too sincere for the sensibilities of our priests.
fetishist_flavor.150.a코0=We must show them the way.

fetishist_flavor.151.t코0=Mwari and the Mhondoro Spirits
fetishist_flavor.151.d코0=While Mwari is the creator of all, and the origin of all power he has a number of subordinate spirits that help him control the world. Similarly a great ruler must rely on subordinate chiefs to run the day-to-day business of the various villages of the realm. As long as we lead a life in accordance with the will of Mwari we can also be sure of the support of the Mhondoro spirits. It therefore comes as no surprise that the diviners of [Root.GetName] have reprimanded the local chiefs and strengthened our hold on the region.
fetishist_flavor.151.a코0=He is the owner of the skies!
fetishist_flavor.152.t코0=Wrath of Mwari
fetishist_flavor.152.d코0=In the recent upheaval in [wrath_of_mwari.GetName] local chiefs under our command have seen fit to punish captured enemy leaders by execution. In doing so, however, they did not consult the diviners of Mwari and have broken a number of his rules. While it is clear to most that these men acted without our official sanction the fact that neither we nor the spirits of Mwari could control them has created a widespread unrest. Especially as locals are claiming that Mwari himself has spoken to show his great dissatisfaction with the way things have transpired.
fetishist_flavor.152.a코0=We will try to do better.
fetishist_flavor.153.t코0=The faith of [Root.GetName]
fetishist_flavor.153.d코0=The local chief of [Root.GetName] is loudly protesting the policies of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] as he claims we are ignoring the voice of Mwari and his deputies. The chief on the other hand claims to have had a close liaison with the local diviners and their Mhondoro spirit. As unlikely as it sounds others have begun to join him in protest and it seems but a matter of time before an open revolt is upon us.
fetishist_flavor.153.a코0=We will have to show them the error of their ways.
fetishist_flavor.154.t코0=Royal Fires
fetishist_flavor.154.d코0=A realm such as ours relies on a certain amount of delegation. Fortunately our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is an excellent judge of character and we also have Mwari and his deputies to help us select and control our realm.\nEven so it is customary for the various chiefs of the realm to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to report and make a show of their loyalty once per year. In a grand ceremony the chiefs are expected to relight their royal fires and bring them back to their province as a sign of their ties to us and to Mwari. It is therefore with great irritation that we note that some of our chiefs this year have neglected to come, instead sending feeble excuses about distance.
fetishist_flavor.154.a코0=We can afford to let them opt out.
fetishist_flavor.154.b코0=If we allow this, more will follow.

fetishist_flavor.170.t코0=Plight of [Root.GetName]
fetishist_flavor.170.d코0=Our people in [Root.GetName] are concerned that the Cwezi spirits are upset with their conduct in the area. According to popular belief there's been a sharp decline in the number of pregnancies and an increase in birth complications which is being attributed to the recent neglect of a minor shrine in [Root.GetCapitalName].
fetishist_flavor.170.a코0=There is nothing we can do.
fetishist_flavor.170.b코0=We must enlist the help of the Cwezi priestesses.
fetishist_flavor.170.b.tt코0=By empowering the Cwezi priestesses and enlisting them to consult with the spirits and perform the ritual of initiation on local women we stand a good chance to avert a local disaster.
fetishist_flavor.170.c코0=We must offer [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] to the Cwezi Spirit.
fetishist_flavor.170.c.tt코0=As the spouse of the Cwezi Spirit [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] will be able to act on our behalf and stop this. She will, however, be unable to serve as the queen of our country ever after.
fetishist_flavor.171.t코0=Support of the Spirits
fetishist_flavor.171.d코0=The Cwezi ancestors have answered our pleas for help and it is widely accepted that the area around [Root.GetName] no longer suffers from the horrible infertility curse that once afflicted it.
fetishist_flavor.171.a코0=We have successfully averted the pending disaster in [Root.GetName].
fetishist_flavor.172.t코0=Spiritual Abandonment
fetishist_flavor.172.d코0=The Cwezi spirits remain unimpressed by our efforts to enlist their help against the horrible fertility plague that has hit [Root.GetName]. Our people are fleeing the area hoping to avoid the horrible curse that according to the widespread belief would make them unable to bear children.
fetishist_flavor.172.a코0=We have been tried and found wanting.
fertility_concerns코0=Declining Fertility
desc_fertility_concerns코0=A marked decline in births in this area indicates that the spirits are upset with us. As a result a large number of our inhabitants here are moving on to other parts of the country hoping to avoid their anger.
fetishist_flavor.173.t코0=Itinerant Sorceress
fetishist_flavor.173.d코0=A group of priestesses led by a powerful sorceress has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking our hospitality. Through the secret ways of spirit possession they can parlay directly with the great Cwezi spirits of old. Refusing their request for hospitality is not really an option - the kind of support we give to this group will likely influence the kind of support we can expect for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].
fetishist_flavor.173.a코0=We can only offer meager accommodations but expect little in return.
fetishist_flavor.173.b코0=Let us remind our people of our close ties to Kitara.

fetishist_flavor.174.da코0=The diviners of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are having visions of impending destruction. They assure us that the Cwezi spirits of old Kitara will do what they can to protect us but we can be sure that dire times are ahead.

fetishist_flavor.174.b코0=The diviners will stand between us and the heroes of old.
fetishist_flavor.175.t코0=Spirit Shrine
fetishist_flavor.175.d코0=The representative of one of the largest shrines in our country has sought an audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asking us to fund an extension and acquire more priests for the Cwezi spirit that resides there. According to the custodian this shrine, while not neglected, is not fit to house our great ancestors and they have let us know that we cannot expect great things as long as we don't do something about this.\nThis would be a worrying thing in itself but it also seems a local demagogue has latched on to this. With [Root.Monarch.GetName] being so vilified by local clergy it's hard not to suspect the two of cooperating.
fetishist_flavor.175.a코0=We will give the priestess free hands.

fetishist_flavor.201.t코0=The People of Enkai
fetishist_flavor.201.d코0=We have come across a tribe who fervently worships a deity whom they call 'Enkai', the Man in the Sky. They seem to place a tremendous importance on cattle and every man counts his wealth in cows, bulls and calves. One cowherd we met told us about the legend of Enkai and the gift he sent to their people. \n\nThe story goes that Enkai was once a human and that his herd contained all the cattle in the world. When the sky was torn from the earth, he sent his herd back down to his people along a bark rope. A tribe of jealous hunters who coveted the meat cut the rope and now the cattle is the only remaining link to Enkai. These people claim to be Enkai's chosen ones and thus all the cattle under the skies belong to them.
fetishist_flavor.201.a코0=We will seek out more knowledge of Enkai and his blessings.
fetishist_flavor.202.t코0=God of the Sky
fetishist_flavor.202.d코0=Lately we have encountered people who fervently worship 'Waaq', whom they claim to be the supreme and all-powerful ruler of the Universe. If their words are to be believed, he created the world and resides in the Heavens from where he watches over us all. Mankind is subject to his will and must always worship and fear him. \n\nThe follows of Waaq pray for peace and harmony above all other things. They believe that the world balances atop the horns of a great bull. Standing in front of him, tied to a pole, is a cow. The equilibrium of the Universe is tied to the love between the bull and the cow. Should she turn away from him, the bull would become anxious and thus the world would shift. This could lead to all manners of disasters on Earth. However as long as we pray and offer gifts to the great Waaq, we shall be safe. At least that is what these people claim.
fetishist_flavor.202.a코0=Teach us more about the mighty Waaq.
fetishist_flavor.203.t코0=The Divided God
fetishist_flavor.203.d코0=As we expand our horizons and encounter new communities we learn of other deities and ways of life. Recently words have reached us of the god 'Zanahary'. He is the Creator of the Universe, split in two - he is both male and female, Light and Dark, Heaven and Earth. The heavenly Zanahary breathes life into the clay bodies shaped by the earthly Zanahary, thus creating humans. When the two sides of Zanahary argue, the breath is withdrawn from the body, resulting in mortality and death.\n\nThe followers of Zanahary do not seem to be all that worried by this, however. They tell us that life is only a temporary state and that the dead are the most important members of the community. The ancestors, or 'razana', are described as gods on earth and act as a mediator between the living and Zanahary.
fetishist_flavor.203.a코0=Intriguing! We must learn more about Zanahary and the razana.

Working the lands is essential to the local economy of [rain_province.GetName], as well as that of surrounding areas, however, they have not been blessed with sufficient rainfall during the last few years. Surely the farmers are already praying to Waaq for a fertile fields and a bountiful harvest, however, the local Wadaad priests believe an organized celebration would prove more effective. They are stressing how vital this year's harvest will be for the future prosperity of the region.

Working the lands is essential to the local economy of [rain_province.GetName] as well as that of surrounding areas, but during the last few years, they have not been blessed with sufficient rainfall. Surely the farmers are already praying to Yemoja, the goddess of fertility, for a bountiful harvest. However, the local elders believe an organized celebration would prove more effective. They are stressing how vital this year's harvest will be for the future prosperity of the region.
fetishist_flavor.204.a코0=We shall help organize a great celebration in Waaq's honor.
fetishist_flavor.204.a.tt코0=Assist the priests of [rain_province.GetName]. A drought would have a significant negative impact on the productivity in the area while good rains would help it prosper. However there are no guarantees that Waaq will listen.
fetishist_flavor.204.b코0=We shall organize a great celebration in honor of the Lady of the Rain.
fetishist_flavor.204.b.tt코0=Assist the elders of [rain_province.GetName]. A drought would have a significant negative impact on the productivity in the area while good rains would help it prosper. However there are no guarantees that Yemoja will listen.

It seems as if our efforts have paid off. It has been many years since the people of the area received this amount of precipitation and still there is no end in sight.

With adulthood comes the responsibility of protecting our people and territory. For ten years they will reside together in the 'Emanyatta', a warrior village, during which they live to serve the nation.\n\nWith this influx to our country's army we also have the opportunity of shaping a new generation of warriors.

fetishist_flavor.208.t코0=The Wrath of Enkai
fetishist_flavor.208.d코0=Most of the time, Enkai is a benevolent and just god. We call him 'Enkai Naibor', God is Black, as he makes dark clouds heavy with rain. However, when we look up at the sky today, this not what we see. Instead the sky is red and dry. During times like these we give him another name 'Enkai Nanyokie', God is Red.\n\nThe drought has struck our people hard. It is getting increasingly hard to find water in some areas and there is barely anything left to eat for our herds. The situation has gotten especially troublesome in the area surrounding the [drought_province.GetName] province. A local 'oloiboni', a spiritual leader, has suggested that every cattle owner should sacrifice eight bulls to appease the great Enkai. While we believe him to be right, forcing such a decree would certainly upset our people.
fetishist_flavor.208.a코0=If we do not sacrifice the cattle, they will perish from the drought anyway.
fetishist_flavor.208.a.tt코0=Order the people of [drought_province.GetName] and the surrounding area to sacrifice a portion of their cattle in an attempt to stop the drought and bring forth rain. There are no guarantees that Enkai will be appeased, however.

The blood and meat we left for the scavengers could have saved many lives, lives which have now been snuffed out under a relentless sun.

Our revered ancestors act as intermediaries between God and the living. We must seek their council and keep them happy in order for our community to thrive.\n\nTo commune with them, we must visit the 'tanindrazana', the land of the ancestors. While our own dwellings are usually humble, the dead reside in great burial tombs. One day we shall join them, but for now our biggest responsibility is to serve our ancestors by maintaining their homes and doing their bidding.

We are cut off from the ancestors and thus from the great Zanahary. Where shall we turn now? Who shall lead the way?

[Root.Monarch.GetName] is the leader of a new generation and as it steps forward we may turn our eyes towards a bright future.

Some of our most respected and influential ancestors reside here in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family mausoleum. While the tomb is still one of the most impressive monuments in the country, maintaining such a sizable building is quite an undertaking and the state of the tomb has begun to deteriorate.

They say he descended from the Heavens and walked among us, teaching about love and forgiveness. In the end, he died on a cross for our sins, only to resurrect and ascend to the Heavens. They say that one day the Savior will come back to Earth to grant his followers eternal life and establish the final Kingdom of God.
fetishist_flavor.400.a코0=Eternal life, you say? Tell us more.

fetishist_flavor.401.d코0=We have met people who devote their lives to worship the one true god they call 'Allah'. They live by the decree given to them by their prophets, the greatest of which went by the name Muhammad. We have been told that to be a true servant of God, one must adhere to the Five Pillars; faith, prayer, charity, fasting and pilgrimage to 'Mecca'.

They reveal how we as humans crave and cling to that which is impermanent, keeping us unsatisfied and trapped in an endless cycle of rebirth, but also how to reach liberation and enlightenment by following the Noble Eightfold Path.
fetishist_flavor.402.a코0=Interesting. Do tell us more.
fetishist_flavor.403.t코0=The Eternal Way
fetishist_flavor.403.d코0=We have stumbled upon believers of Sanatana Dharma, or the eternal way. They value a virtuous and moral life, stability, and freedom from ignorance. It seems they worship not one but several gods to aid them in their journey to betterment, mentioning names like Shiva the Destroyer, and Vishnu the Preserver. They urge our people to consider our actions in this life, and through 'karma', the spiritual cause and effect, we can seek to be worthy of a better life after this one. The highest goal of all is to end the cycle of birth and rebirth...
fetishist_flavor.403.a코0=This sounds worth investigating.
fetishist_flavor.404.t코0=The Might of the Sun
fetishist_flavor.404.d코0=The people across the sea are intriguing. At first it was just their golden symbols and elaborate pyramids inspiring awe in our warriors, but recently even some of our prominent members of society have begun exploring the faith underlying this mystical life. So far, we have found a pantheon of gods, and ritual in all things - we have heard stories such as that of the New Fire ceremony, or Xiuhmolpilli, where following weeks of bodily abstinence, blood-ritual, and even a vow of silence, a man is sacrificed atop of an old fire mountain, thus beginning a new cycle of their 52-year calendar.\n\nFrom what we understand, much of their worldview is based on staving off the end of the world, an idea proving reasonable among some of our warriors.
fetishist_flavor.404.a코0=To face death is part of living.
fetishist_flavor.405.t코0=Lady of the Slain
fetishist_flavor.405.d코0=We have encountered a woman who claims to be a representative of the 'seidkonur', an order of shamanistic seeresses. She tells us they follow the goddess 'Freyja', the patroness of love, magic and war. She rides to battle in a chariot pulled by two cats, dressed in an enchanted falcon feather cloak, and among the fallen warriors she chooses half to reside in her realm 'Fólkvangr'. She promises that if we swear our fealty to Freyja, the seid magic will be ours, to be used for good or evil...
fetishist_flavor.405.a코0=A most intriguing promise.
fetishist_flavor.406.t코0=The Laws of Igziabeher
fetishist_flavor.406.d코0=Some moons ago, words reached us of a people who call themselves 'Israelites' and claim to be the chosen people of Igziabeher, the One God. We have reached out and spoken with some of them since.\n\nThey have told us how, through the prophet Muse, they have received Igziabeher's laws. They are written in the 'Orit', their holy scripture, of which they have gifted us a copy. In return for following these laws the Israelites are under His protection. They are awaiting the arrival of King Messiay who shall rule the Kingdom of God and usher in an age of eternal peace and freedom. There will be no more death and those who have previously passed on will be resurrected by Igziabeher. Anyone who has followed God's laws will live forever in happiness while the sinners shall be punished and executed.
fetishist_flavor.406.a코0=Eternal life, they say? We will have someone study the Orit, very closely...
fetishist_flavor.407.t코0=The Eternal Fire
fetishist_flavor.407.d코0=A group of travelers have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] demanding an audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With them they bring a fire that must not be extinguished, and which they claim to have kept alive for months as they journeyed from far-away lands to seek our protection. They follow the great prophet Zoroaster and we have been led to understand their original home was lost centuries ago. Since then they survive in communities around the Indian Ocean where they keep practicing their ancient ways.\nThe strangers seem eager to share their knowledge about how the world is in a constant struggle between order and chaos, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu but do not seem to expect us to take it to heart. They do ask to be allowed to set up a temple for their fire in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and promise that while they are few they will be able to enrich our society, much like sugar poured in milk can make the entire drink more sweet and soothing.
fetishist_flavor.407.a코0=Humata, Hukhta, Huvarshta.
fetishist_flavor.408.t코0=A Rite of Fertility
fetishist_flavor.408.d.a코0=The 'Wotan', chief-shaman of the seidkonur seeresses, have approached us concerning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lack of children. While we have mainly been worried about the line of succession, the Wotan is also worried about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] devotion to Freyja. She suggests a fertility rite in which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will lie with one of the seidkonur. If Freyja is presented with sufficient respect and sacrifices, the Wotan is convinced that such a union will produce a strong and blessed child.
fetishist_flavor.408.d.b코0=The 'Wotan', chief-shaman of the seidkonur seeresses, have approached us concerning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s lack of children. While we have mainly been worried about the line of succession, the Wotan is also worried about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] devotion to Freyja. She suggests a fertility rite in which the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will lie with a 'seidmadur', one of the rare male seid practitioners. If Freyja is presented with sufficient respect and sacrifices, the Wotan is convinced that such a union will produce a strong and blessed child.
fetishist_flavor.408.a코0=It cannot hurt. At least the seidkonur will be pleased.
fetishist_flavor.408.a.tt코0=Arrange an impressive fertility rite with the hopes of producing an heir. While the Wotan certainly seems convinced, the Gods are known to be fickle and there are no guarantees. A failed rite could even harm the honor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§!.
fetishist_flavor.408.b코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not need divine intervention to produce an heir!
fetishist_flavor.408.b.tt코0=Do not go through with the Wotan's idea.

desc_displeased_the_wotan코0=We did not agree to the Wotan's suggestion, which earned us the disapproval of her and the rest of the seidkonur.
fetishist_flavor.409.t코0=The Lady's Blessing
fetishist_flavor.409.d.a코0=Praised be Freyja, most beautiful lady of love and fertility! Our mighty and pious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has fathered not one, but two children! The seidkona from the fertility rite has given birth to a couple of strong and healthy twin daughters. As Freyja herself is a mother of two girls, this has been interpreted as a sign of divine approval. In Freyja's honor the infants have been named Hnoss and Gersemi after her daughters. The Wotan ensures us that either girl will make a fine ruler one day.
fetishist_flavor.409.d.b코0=Praised be Freyja, most beautiful lady of love and fertility! Our vibrant and pious [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is the mother of not one, but two children! Nine months after the fertility rite she gave birth to a couple of strong and healthy twin daughters. As Freyja herself is a mother of two girls, this has been interpreted as a sign of divine approval. In Freyja's honor the infants have been named Hnoss and Gersemi after her daughters. The Wotan ensures us that either girl will make a fine ruler one day.
fetishist_flavor.409.a코0=Beautiful Hnoss will lead our people!

fetishist_flavor.410.t코0=A Withheld Blessing
fetishist_flavor.410.d.a코0=It has been months since the fertility rite and the seidkona whom [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] lay with shows no sign of being with child. Despite the impressive sacrifice in Freyja's honor, she did not grant the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] her blessing. People are whispering about the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s lacking manhood and the uncertain future of our nation...

Despite the impressive sacrifice in Freyja's honor, she did not grant the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] her blessing. People are whispering about the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s barren womb and the uncertain future of our nation...
fetishist_flavor.410.a코0=Freyja, why have you forsaken us?
fetishist_flavor.411.t코0=The Power of Magic
fetishist_flavor.411.d코0=The chief-shaman of the seidkonur seeresses has approached us in this time of strife. She tells us that a well-woven spell, with Freyja's blessing, might be beneficial for us in the war against the [freyja_enemy.GetAdjective] infidels. While Freya's seidkonur certainly are powerful, our advisors also warn us that magic is a fickle thing and spells have been known to backfire...
fetishist_flavor.411.a코0=Protect our brave warriors! May they never fall in battle.
fetishist_flavor.411.a.tt코0=Ask the seidkonur to weave a spell for success in war, at your own risk...
fetishist_flavor.411.a.pos코0=a positive outcome.

fetishist_flavor.411.c.tt코0=Decline the Wotan's offer.
fetishist_flavor.412.t코0=Warriors of Freyja
fetishist_flavor.412.d코0=Lately our brave warriors have been performing above expectation, as if guided by a higher power. It seems as if the spell the seidkonur wove did turn out successful, after all.
fetishist_flavor.412.a코0=All glory to Freyja, fiercest of all goddesses!

fetishist_flavor.413.t코0=The Greed of Freyja
fetishist_flavor.413.d코0=Lately we have been unfortunate in battle. Several great warriors have fallen even though we had the odds stacked in our favor. Many are pointing fingers at the seidkonur, blaming our misfortune on their spell. They believe that Freyja was angered by our demands and decided to claim more brave champions to her realm 'Fólkvangr', but the seeresses insist that they are not to blame.
fetishist_flavor.413.a코0=Freyja can be a harsh mistress.
greed_of_freyja코0=Greed of Freyja
desc_greed_of_freyja코0=The nation's warriors are performing below expectation. As they fall in battle, some say Freyja is claiming our best champions for herself.
fetishist_flavor.414.t코0=Goddess of Love
fetishist_flavor.414.d코0=Lately our diplomats seem to be doing everything right. They keep impressing everyone they meet with their fine manners, extensive knowledge and witty conversation. We should take advantage of our fortune to build stronger relationships with future allies. It seems as if the spell the seidkonur wove did turn out successful, after all.
fetishist_flavor.414.a코0=No one can dislike those who are blessed by Freyja.
beloved_diplomats코0=Beloved Diplomats
desc_beloved_diplomats코0=Our diplomats are welcome at almost every court, where their manners, knowledge and friendliness are much appreciated.
fetishist_flavor.415.t코0=Unintended Insults
fetishist_flavor.415.d코0=Lately our diplomats have made one mistake after the other. Usually they are well-mannered and poised, yet many of their latest engagements have ended disastrously. By sheer luck, they have not offended anyone too important so far, although we should be careful. Many are pointing fingers at the seidkonur, blaming our misfortune on their spell. They believe that Freyja was displeased that we would rather talk than fight our way through war, but the seeresses insist that they are not to blame.
scorned_diplomats코0=Scorned Diplomats
desc_scorned_diplomats코0=Our diplomats have an unfortunate knack of making tactless mistakes in delicate situations. They no longer get invites to important events like they used to.
fetishist_flavor.416.t코0=The Fourth Path
fetishist_flavor.416.d코0=The wise Buddha taught us to follow the Noble Eightfold Path in order to be released from the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. The Fourth Path, 'Samyag Karman' or Right Action, says that we must not perform sensual misconduct, take that which is not ours, injure or kill. In many ways, Samyag Karman has made our nation stable and prosperous, but it does have its disadvantages. As not to displease the Buddha, monks in the [no_killing_province.GetName] province have been encouraging our subjects not to join the army. At first their influence was negligible, however, over time the word has spread and we are starting to feel the consequences.
fetishist_flavor.416.a코0=Staying true to the Noble Path is an honorable endeavor.
fetishist_flavor.416.a.tt코0=Allow the men who want to follow the Noble Path to stay out of the army.
fetishist_flavor.416.b코0=Their duty to our nation is greater than that to the Buddha!
fetishist_flavor.416.b.tt코0=Force the deserters to join the army. They, along with their kin, will probably put up some resistance.

desc_doing_no_harm코0=Some of the able-bodied men of this province refuse to join the army because of religious convictions – at least so they claim.
forced_conscription코0=Forced Conscription
desc_forced_conscription코0=Some men in this province are forced to join the army, despite their religious convictions.
fetishist_flavor.417.t코0=The Spirit of Generosity
fetishist_flavor.417.d코0=In order to grow as human beings and approach spiritual liberation, we must earn merit. According to the teachings of the Buddha, we do so through good deeds, acts and thoughts, and the accumulation of merit will carry over to our coming incarnations. The utmost sign of a good heart is the willing transfer of merit to others. This proves that we do not only perform good deeds, acts and thoughts for our own benefit, but for that of everyone else as well.\n\nOur great ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], has arranged a great ceremony at the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family shrine. At the end [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will pass on the merit which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gathered during the ritual. Whom shall [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dedicate it to?
selfless_ruler코0=Selfless Ruler
desc_selfless_ruler코0=During a great ceremony our ruler selflessly dedicated merit to all sentient life.
fetishist_flavor.417.a코0=[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] ancestors, in order to ease their suffering in the next life.

fetishist_flavor.418.t코0=Returning to the Flock
fetishist_flavor.418.d코0=Over a thousand years ago, the Israelites were exiled from the Promised Land and since then the children of Abraham have been spread across the world with no real realm to call their own. Over time, our traditions and practices have changed and diverged. We ourselves only recently found our way back to Igziabeher and are now fiercely protective of our own emerging Haymanot identity. \n\nA big tribe of wanderers have recently arrived in the [Root.GetName] province. While they also claim to be the descendants of Abraham, and many of their customs mirror our own, there are certain differences. When they pray, they do so to 'Yahweh' and the scripture they carry is named the 'Torah'. They have requested to settle here under our protection. While many of them are skilled craftsmen and wise scholars, resources which would without doubt benefit our nation, our advisors warn us about the friction which is certain to appear between these newcomers and our current subjects...
fetishist_flavor.418.a코0=Of course our brothers and sisters shall stay!
fetishist_flavor.418.a.tt코0=A large number of Jewish immigrants settle in the [Root.GetName] province.
fetishist_flavor.418.b코0=They are not like us, not true followers of Igziabeher.
fetishist_flavor.418.b.tt코0=The Jewish immigrants are exiled.

desc_jewish_immigrants코0=This province has recently had a large influx of Jewish immigrants.
fetishist_flavor.419.t코0=Demand of the Jews
fetishist_flavor.419.d코0=While they were certainly grateful at first, the Jewish population of [Root.GetName] has been growing increasingly discontent. The friction between them and the Haymanot subjects has caused us many sleepless nights. The Jews have also begun to complain about the lack of influence that they have in the nation's affairs, now that they have become a part of it. They demand that one of their leaders, the guild master Isaiah, shall be given a seat on the council of advisors. While it would surely satisfy the Jews, we would also weaken our religious authority and anger our more fanatical subjects.
fetishist_flavor.419.a코0=We shall happily accept Isaiah's wise counsel.
fetishist_flavor.419.b코0=Have we not given you enough? Ungrateful leeches...

desc_dissatisfied_jews코0=The local Jewish population is discontent with the lack of influence they have regarding the running of our nation.
fetishist_flavor.420.t코0=Desecration of the Sanbat
fetishist_flavor.420.d코0=On the Seventh Day after Igziabeher had created the world, He rested. In His honor, we keep the seventh day of the week holy. During the Sanbat, from sundown the day previous until the stars emerge, we do not work, write or cook. We even do not light any fires. Desecrating the Sanbat is a crime against God's laws. \n\nWord has gotten out that one of our most trusted advisors, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], often works during Sanbat. While some of the more extreme protesters demand that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] be stoned to death for [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] sinful ways, we do not want to set a dangerous precedent. After all, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is not the only one at court to violate the Sanbat, even though [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] is the most regular and least discreet culprit. Simply firing [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] would surely appease the majority, although [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] experience would make it a great loss...
fetishist_flavor.420.a코0=We cannot allow such a poor moral character to represent our government.
fetishist_flavor.420.b코0=[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is too important to our [Root.GovernmentName]. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] will stay.
fetishist_flavor.450.t코0=The Nature of God
fetishist_flavor.450.d코0=Our veneration of the Christian God has generally brought us much closer to the [christian_neighbor.GetAdjective] but there's always a slight feeling that we are talking past each other rather than about the same things when it comes to matters of theology. This was even further highlighted today when during a joint ceremony of state our ambassador in [christian_neighbor.GetName] got into a heated argument about the nature of the Holy Trinity. The [christian_neighbor.GetAdjective] quite clearly take offense at the way the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are worshipped in our lands.
fetishist_flavor.450.a코0=Something must have been lost in translation?
fetishist_flavor.450.b코0=Apologize and attempt to mend the disagreement.
fetishist_flavor.451.t코0=The Greater Christian Community
fetishist_flavor.451.d코0=To the greater Christian World our veneration of their God must seem like a miracle. While they may take issue with some of our interpretations there seems to be a general relief that the word of God can be spread among the pagans. Wherever they go our diplomats seem to be greeted with open arms.
fetishist_flavor.451.a코0=Kyrie Eleison
fetishist_flavor.451.a.tt코0=Relations with all Christian countries improved by §G50§!.
fetishist_flavor.452.t코0=Christian Mission in [Root.GetName]
fetishist_flavor.452.d코0=By opening our arms to the Christian God we have also attracted a number of his disciples. A constant trickle of merchants, priests, monks and adventurers is now, among other things, helping spread the word of God in our lands.\nA group of missionaries from [christian_missionary_origin.GetName] now wishes to settle in [Root.GetName].
fetishist_flavor.452.a코0=What harm could come from welcoming men of God?
fetishist_flavor.452.b코0=We must maintain control over the faithful ourselves.

fetishist_flavor.455.t코0=A Far-Away Traveler
fetishist_flavor.455.d코0=A learned Qadi, well schooled in Islamic jurisprudence has seen fit to grace our country with his visit. It seems he is traveling through the Islamic world to bring order and structure to the legal system and observe the various ways in which the life and words of the prophet are thought. While it is a great honor for such a man to visit [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] it would perhaps be even more beneficial if we could convince him to stay...
fetishist_flavor.455.a코0=Let us offer him a generous appanage.
fetishist_flavor.455.b코0=What a great day.
fetishist_flavor.456.t코0=Shirazi Merchants
fetishist_flavor.456.d코0=A group of Shirazi Merchants from the East have established themselves in [Root.GetName] hoping to bring new goods to the port cities from which they come. While the Shirazi claim to originate from a few families that once were the first Muslims to settle the African coast, their Islam is one that generously intermixes rituals and magical ceremonies. In [Root.GetName] they feel at home and the local population has taken no issue with them.
fetishist_flavor.456.a코0=Great.
fetishist_flavor.457.t코0=Religious Tensions in [Root.GetName]
fetishist_flavor.457.d코0=Our adoption of Islam as our new religion has generally been quite frictionless. At least in the areas where Muslims are still not a majority. In [Root.GetName], however, the new religion has a great number of practitioners, some who feel our theology is a bit on the liberal side. A recent influx of converts from the less religiously orthodox part of the country has created notable tensions. In order to control his subjects our local representative has brought even more recent converts as soldiers which has only inflamed the situation further. It seems but a matter of time before violence erupts...
fetishist_flavor.457.a코0=Replace the governor immediately.
fetishist_flavor.457.b코0=We must use force to calm the situation.
fetishist_flavor.458.t코0=Spread of Islam
fetishist_flavor.458.d코0=[muslim_missionary_origin.GetAdjective] missionaries have become an increasingly common sight in [Root.GetName] and their message has struck home well with the province population. It has currently gone so far that it is unclear if the province can be said to adhere to the traditions of their ancestors anymore. For better or worse [Root.GetName] is now a truly Islamic area.
fetishist_flavor.458.a코0=God is great.

fetishist_flavor.460.t코0=Zoroastrian Migration
fetishist_flavor.460.d코0=Word has spread among the various exiled Zoroastrian communities of our veneration of the Mazdayasna faith. The fire temples of [Root.GetCapitalName] have attracted particular fame, and now great numbers of Zoroastrians have begun to arrive in the area to start a new life in what they hope will be a more hospitable land.\nWhile some find it disconcerting that the province is so quickly losing touch with the traditions of our ancestors the steady stream of scholars, merchants and other valuable men and women will certainly help the area grow.

fetishist_flavor.461.t코0=[Root.GetName] Fire Extinguished
fetishist_flavor.461.d코0=Over time an increasing number of fire temples have been consecrated using the original fire that was brought to us by the followers of Zoroaster. As the faith becomes more common, however, it has also managed to anger some of our more traditionally oriented of our subjects. A fire temple consecrated quite close to the shrine of one of the more venerated ancestors in [Root.GetName] has led to open hostility between the followers of the old ways and the 'Magi' from the east. The traditionalists have stormed into the temple and extinguished the holy fire.

fetishist_flavor.500.t코0=The Council of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]
fetishist_flavor.500.d코0=Our elders worry that peace and good fortune has made recent generations of our community deteriorate - they say our warriors have grown soft and the minds of our scholars dull. 'This is not what Teotl worship should look like', they argue. To placate these learned members of our society we could arrange for a building be built, to house scholars and diviners to map the stars. We could also perform a blood sacrifice, in the name of the Sun God.
fetishist_flavor.500.a코0=Build an observatory.
fetishist_flavor.500.a.tt코0=If the venture proves successful a mighty pyramid could grant us sublime knowledge for generations.
fetishist_flavor.500.b코0=Trust in the power of sacrifice.
fetishist_flavor.500.b.tt코0=If the sacrifice goes according to plan our ruler will be renowned for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] devotion.

fetishist_flavor.501.a코0=Perfect!
fetishist_flavor.502.t코0=The Blood of a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]
fetishist_flavor.502.d코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of our magnificent [Root.GovernmentName] stepped up to the altar with fierce determination. The setting sun glinted in the obsidian blade [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] held and the chanting of the priests intensified. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] made a deft cut down the length of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arm, the crowd cheered. The blood still dripping from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] nodded solemnly to the elders seated in the audience. One of them smiled as a queue of eager warriors began to form to the altar.
fetishist_flavor.502.a코0=For the Sun!
fetishist_flavor.503.t코0=The Architecture of Failure
fetishist_flavor.503.d코0=Bad weather and poor management has led workers to lay down their tools and give up the construction of an observatory. Instead they are complaining of having too long put up with unjust wages and working conditions - some have even taken to torching the allotted site of construction. The disgruntled members of the elder council shake their heads.
fetishist_flavor.503.a코0=Typical!
fetishist_flavor.504.t코0=Under the Scrutiny of the Ancestors
fetishist_flavor.504.d코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] nervously stepped up to the altar. The blade quivered in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand while the crowd held their breath. Closing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] then pressed the dagger into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] skin... \n\nThe cut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] placed must've gone deep because the blood that flowed onto the stone floor quickly painted it red as it dripped down the steps. The liquid glistened in the embers of twilight and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] just had time to hear the priests replace their chant with gasps before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] passed out.\n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] awoke again, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not quite the same.
fetishist_flavor.504.a코0=How embarrassing!
fetishist_flavor.505.t코0=Golden Idols
fetishist_flavor.505.d코0=A fine craftsman of golden jewelry has gained some renown in our lands. His popularity has allowed him to expand his workshop substantially and he has already taken several apprentices under his wing. Our nobility is especially intrigued by his specialization in delicate golden idols - representing various gods and kept for divine protection, they come in the form of snakes, eagles, and jaguars. Unsurprising, it has become the highest fashion to keep these totems close, preferably as a pendant around one's neck.
fetishist_flavor.505.a코0=How charming!
fetishist_flavor.506.t코0=The Unity of Blood
fetishist_flavor.506.d코0=This morning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] received a missive from one of the elders in [worried_province.GetName], assuring us of the benefits of a grand sacrifice to the Cloud Serpent.\n\nThere is no denying that the weather these past months have been unusually dry, particularly in [worried_province.GetName]. The people there worry about their crops while the local elders are voicing their opinion more loudly each day - their diviners have been predicting this for months, they say, questioning the nonchalance and lack of faith of the villagers. There is a strange air of elitism brewing among the elders as some scoff at the anxious farmers now seeking their council.\n\nLooking over the missive again, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is puzzled. Perhaps an elaborate ceremony is precisely what is needed to stabilize the region?
fetishist_flavor.506.a코0=Order an extravagant ceremony of blood!
fetishist_flavor.506.b코0=We have more important things going on.
fetishist_flavor.507.t코0=Under a Cold Moon
fetishist_flavor.507.d코0=The moon hung ominously in the sky above the crowd, the faces of the priests lit red by light from their torches. The air was silent, save for the shuffling of feet, leading up to the altar - a dozen men were being led, or dragged, towards the center stage of the ceremony. [worried_province.GetName] has rarely seen such ritual and it was clear that this would have an impact on the crowd, young and old, nervously watching. After having spent a month in silence, the high priest finally called out pleadingly to the gods as an unfortunate villager was held down on the altar. His heart, along with those of the other sacrifices, was about to be cut out of his body, 'set free' to join the spirits.
fetishist_flavor.507.a코0=We should do this again sometime.
fetishist_flavor.507.b코0=This is our way of life.
fetishist_flavor.508.t코0=A Wasted Effort
fetishist_flavor.508.d코0=It was a dark and cloudy evening when the people of [worried_province.GetName], as ordered by their elders, had gathered to stand witness to the grand sacrifice. 'This will save [worried_province.GetName],' the high priest proclaimed. 'It will stop the drought, but it hardly seems necessary anymore', people muttered, some glancing at the sky. Were those rain clouds? \nThe intended gifts to the Cloud Serpent shrieked and wept in protest as they were dragged to the stage of the ceremony. The tension lay heavy and one elder shifted his weight nervously.\nSuddenly the sky cracked with thunder and rain began to pour down on the scene. The crowd broke into chaos as screaming and shouting filled the air - some villagers were struggling to rescue their loved ones from being sacrificed in vain! The ceremonial knife, risen in terrified defense by the high priest, came slashing down in panic at people as the venerated elders attempted to flee the stage.

His fellow men treat him with the utmost respect, as if he was of the Brahmin caste. A curiosity, the man shuns earthly possessions and never asks for more than the opportunity to preach his insight to others - in fact he has become something of a local attraction as people seek his aid in all sorts of matters, ranging between those of the heart to those of agriculture or civic duty. Some of the nobility argue that he'll start charging money for his advice any day now, while others see him as clearly meant for something other than spending the remainder of his life meditating in the local temple.
fetishist_flavor.510.a코0=Make him our entrusted advisor.

fetishist_flavor.511.t코0=Sacred Writing
fetishist_flavor.511.d코0=[dharmic_neighbor.GetName] have sent us a furious letter, informing us of a troublesome [Root.GetAdjective] monk selling books within their borders, while passing them off as sacred texts. Not only is it obviously counterfeit material, but the writing also contains several errors in regards to the Hindu worldview, and the authorities in [dharmic_neighbor.GetName] are accusing us of trying to instigate religious riots in their streets. There is the argument that the monk was simply trying to explore his own philosophy, but considering the popularity of the writings in [dharmic_neighbor.GetName], it is reasonable to assume that this monk is indeed a charlatan using our faith to make money...\n\nThe damage already done, all we can do is send troops to find and escort the monk out of the country of [dharmic_neighbor.GetName].

consort_events.1.t코0=An Offer of Marriage
consort_events.1.da코0=It is with some consternation that the mighty families of the realm have watched [Root.Monarch.GetName] letting the years pass [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by without finding someone to marry. These feelings have now turned into open dismay as despite the realm lacking a clear line of succession our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] appears to have no plans to find a spouse nor is [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] showing much interest the proposals sent to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].\nIt has now reached the point where the court is expecting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to accept one of the offers on the table. Continued failure to secure the succession puts the entire realm at risk. Luckily one of the oldest and most prestigious [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] families in the [Root.GovernmentName] has offered us the hand of one of their daughters, along with a generous dowry.
consort_events.1.db코0=Ruling a great [Root.GovernmentName] can be busy work and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has never shied away from that challenge. As the years go by, however, it has become increasingly clear that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is not devoting the expected time and effort to find a new consort. While it is reasonable to expect a certain period of mourning that time is now long past.\nIt is high time [Root.Monarch.GetName] takes a new spouse. Luckily, when you are a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the high ranking families of the realm are eager to lend a helping hand.
consort_events.1.dc코0=The stability of a hereditary realm rests on having a clear succession. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] remains an unmarried [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] despite having reached a marriageable age without a clear heir. Some of the finest families in our [Root.GovernmentName] would be overjoyed to help us in this matter and would likely be ready to pay an astronomical dowry for the privilege.

consort_events.1.a코0=Accept the offer.
consort_events.1.a.tt코0=By accepting this offer it is understood that the family of our new spouse can expect certain favors in the future.

consort_events.2.d코0=With the union of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetName] we have gained not only a spouse but also a new ally in the realm. The [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] is an old and influential family and their seat in [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is a jewel of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nOf course friendship has to go both ways and [Root.Consort.GetName] will be expected to speak for [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] kin while our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be expected consider such advice very carefully.
consort_events.2.a코0=To everlasting friendship!
consort_events.2.a.tt코0=[origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is the seat of the family of our [Root.Consort.GetTitle]. This province will be less likely to revolt but will be granted privileges making it harder to tax or convert.
consort_events.3.t코0=Great Expectations
consort_events.3.d코0=A political marriage is as much a union as it is a contract of mutual support. The [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] family expects that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will heed the advice of the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] and actively look after their (and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]) interests.

At times this is not an arrangement without benefits.\nToday [Root.Consort.GetName] seems very pleased to announce that [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] family has decided to show its support for the throne and for the union of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetName].

Now that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is the Royal Regent of the realm they are ecstatic. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now one of, if not the, most powerful [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] in the realm and the family has made it very clear to us that they expect to be treated in accordance to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position.

consort_events.6.d코0=A royal marriage is rarely a matter of love. Rather, it is a diplomatic opportunity which is not to be wasted. It is also of great importance that the future consort is of suitable status and it is advantageous if she or he is a foreigner, so as not to disturb the balance of internal politics. \n\nHowever, even a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can become lovestruck. Then all such matters seem to melt away - from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] point of view, at least. A local from the [consort_home.GetName] province has caught [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s eye. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] appears to be happier than ever, entirely and endlessly enamored. While our nobles and advisors are less than pleased, the union between [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] beloved has strong support among the commoners of the realm.

At the time little was said about [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] origin or [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] upbringing in [origin_country_of_consort.Capital.GetCapitalName] - to most common folk in [Root.Country.GetName] royals are a breed of their own and they care little for such details. However, rumors bringing these issues to light have recently begun to spread... Some say that the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has refused to let go of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] old [origin_country_of_consort.Religion.GetName] faith - while the people may have understood the need for a marriage with foreigners they are less likely to do so when it comes to being ruled by a heretic.

Considering that this is also the homeland of our [Root.Consort.GetTitle] it is no wonder that [Root.Consort.GetName] has been met with increasing animosity. For all they know [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be harboring loyalties towards the old country, or worse - [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] could be a spy! And is it not a funny coincidence, the nobles argue, that the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become so dependent on the advice of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse?\n\nOur military advisor $ARMY_ORGANISER$$ARMY_REFORMER$$COMMANDANT$$GRAND_CAPTAIN$$MASTER_RECRUITER$$MILITARY_ENGINEER$$QUARTERMASTER$ has gone so far as to threaten to leave court if the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not distance [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] from the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] and [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] untrustworthy whispers.
consort_events.53.a코0=The [Root.Consort.GetTitle] needs our support.

consort_events.54.t코0=The Skills of the [Root.Consort.GetTitle]
consort_events.54.da코0=Ever since [Root.Consort.GetName] arrived at court [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has taken a great interest in the administrative affairs of [Root.GetName]. It has reached a point where the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has become something of an authority on matters relating staff and running the castle, trusted not only by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] but by the nobility in general. Rarely has the [Root.GovernmentName] seen such efficiency.
consort_events.54.db코0=Anybody who has had any sort verbal interaction with [Root.Consort.GetName] can attest to the fact that [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has a way with words. Whether [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] was schooled to become a diplomat or not, dealing with foreign ministers and delicate matters of the court appears to be something the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is well suited for - it would seem [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] mere presence has a calming effect on people.
consort_events.54.dc코0=[Root.Consort.GetName] is becoming well-known for [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] interest in the military. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] is often seen walking with our generals, engaged in deep conversation, and [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has even begun attending the council of war. At first it seemed that the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] was simply curious and wanted to learn about military strategy, but recently [Root.Consort.GetName] has moved on to offering [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] own advice - advice which people listen to. It is clear that the [Root.Consort.GetWomanMan] is suited for these matters.
consort_events.54.dd코0=Even before [Root.Consort.GetName] married into the highest ranks of nobility that [Root.GetName] has to offer, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] was known to be a multi-faceted [Root.Consort.GetWomanMan], often impressing many a guest with [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] scholarly intellect and wit, while also displaying an impressive knowledge of military strategy. Perhaps this is why [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] was chosen as the royal spouse? Regardless, since [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] arrival at court, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has continued to make an outstanding impression on noble and commoner alike.
consort_events.54.a코0=[Root.Consort.GetName] is a blessing.

consort_events.55.da코0=The [Root.Consort.GetTitle] has been pacing the palace lately, [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] head hung low, only stopping sometimes to longingly gaze out the window. Life is quite different here, compared to [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] old country of [origin_country_of_consort.GetName], a nation some call our enemy nowadays. Where does that leave [Root.Consort.GetName], as a traitor to at least one side of it? [Root.Consort.GetName] shakes [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] head - such thoughts help no one, [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] place is here, in [Root.GetName], by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nWhen doubt besets [Root.Consort.GetHerHim] [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] tends to seek out the young [Root.Heir.GetName], as the innocent laughter and calm eyes of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] [Root.Heir.GetDaughterSon] usually brings a smile to [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] face. Today, however, not even this helps. Perhaps it's the weather?

consort_events.306.df코0=The first time [Root.Consort.GetName] watched [Root.Monarch.GetName] sparring with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] soldiers in training, [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] was impressed. It's not every noble[Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] that would enjoy the manual labor of actually learning how to wield a weapon of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own. 'But [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not any [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]', [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] thought before approaching [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] [Root.Monarch.GetWifeHusband] to compliment [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] skills. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] even mustered the courage to ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] opinion on the current military situation of the [Root.GovernmentName]. Intrigued by this mutual interest in the military aspects of [Root.GetName], the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has gained a lot of new ideas for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] army.
consort_events.306.a코0=Those two make a great match.
consort_events.307.t코0=Sharing Faults
consort_events.307.da코0=Although our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] hasn't been the sharpest tool when it comes to managing the finances of [Root.GetName], it is with interest that people have been watching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Consort.GetWifeHusband] together - they seem to get along well, often overheard discussing frivolities and joking about how to spend the country's treasury in order to annoy people the most. ‘Just let them have cake!', [Root.Consort.GetName] says, smiling wickedly.
consort_events.307.db코0=Some say [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a crude [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan]. While [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] certainly has [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] good sides as well, a way with words is not something our ruler is known for. However, observing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Consort.GetWifeHusband] in attendance, it seems that the couple has found common ground in this diplomatic shortcoming. There appears to be a mutual feeling of affection growing between the royals, born of their shared awkwardness.
consort_events.307.dc코0=[Root.Monarch.GetName] never enjoyed being coaxed into physical training as a child. Still anxious whenever someone approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with an expectation of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] showing any sort of combat prowess, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was delighted to find that [Root.Consort.GetName] appears equally nervous around weapons and talk of bloodshed. Together they have bonded over the finer things in life, leaving the dreary conversations concerning warfare and military strategy to other more interested parties.
consort_events.307.a코0=Those two go well together.

consort_events.308.t코0=Remembering the Consort
consort_events.308.da코0=After more than ten years of marriage, [Root.Monarch.GetName] is at a loss without [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse. Many days [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is found staring idly into the thin air, only to have [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors snap [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] back to reality, their expressions anxious. They all agree that it is time something was done to see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] through this difficult time.

They all agree that it is time something was done to see the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] through this difficult time.

consort_events.309.t코0=The Success of the Succession
consort_events.309.da코0=Since the death of [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] spouse, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has been growing increasingly comfortable in [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] seat, as both guardian of the young heir as well as royal regent of [Root.GetName]. To the general public, it is clear that the situation is temporary and simply a political necessity while everyone awaits the crowning of little [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName]. Meanwhile, there are rumors of other characters, said to partake in clandestine meetings where they discuss, in their eyes, the honest potential of the young heir... 'Putting that drooling imbecile on the throne would be a threat to the entire realm', one conspirator mutters. ‘The [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is certainly a capable [Root.Consort.GetWomanMan], and a much better option', another argues.\n\nAlthough certainly aware of these cunning forces, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetHerselfHimself] has yet to take a stand on this highly sensitive issue.
consort_events.309.a코0=These are interesting times...
consort_events.309.a.tt코0=The [Root.Consort.GetTitle] will contemplate these ideas with her closest council.
consort_events.309.b코0=How treasonous! We'll have no more of these ideas.
consort_events.309.b.tt코0=The instigators will not be encouraged.
consort_events.310.t코0=A Shift in Power
consort_events.310.da코0=Utilizing advice from [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] closest advisors and not without putting [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] own charm to the test, the [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has cleverly manipulated a good amount of members of the court into agreement: [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName], the royal heir and next in line to the throne, is a feeble-minded fool, unworthy of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] legacy. However, there is one simple solution to the problem...\nDuring yet another extravagant feast thrown in order to appeal to the nobility in charge, [Root.Consort.GetName] and [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] lackeys has managed to spread the idea of keeping the young [Root.Heir.GetName] locked away in [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] quarters - some isolation would allow the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] child to focus on [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] education, it is argued. That the young heir might also fade from the public eye is unfortunate for [Root.Heir.GetName], but ultimately a bonus for [Root.GetName]...
consort_events.310.a코0=Make it happen.
consort_events.310.b코0=Actually, maybe the young [Root.Heir.GetName] deserves a chance after all.

consort_events.311.t코0=A [Root.Consort.GetTitle] of the People
consort_events.311.d코0=It has become clear to us that [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] is a [Root.Consort.GetWomanMan] with a heart of gold. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] always does [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] best to please [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] [Root.Monarch.GetWifeHusband], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and treats [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] friends with unparalleled kindness. During a recent trip to the [poor_province.GetName] province [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] saw the suffering of its poorest peasants with [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] own eyes. Ever since, [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has been drafting a plan to help [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] most destitute subjects. In order to make these ideas into reality, however, [Root.Consort.GetName] needs some funds from the nation's treasury.
consort_events.311.a코0=The people are ours to look after. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] has our support.
consort_events.311.b코0=We have more important matters to deal with.
consort_events.312.t코0=Two of a Kind
consort_events.312.da코0=Our [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has impressed many men and women at court with [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] sharp wit and extensive knowledge of the natural world. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] has long been a collector of tomes on botany and chemistry, and [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] corresponds with several of our generation's brightest minds. Currently one of these scientists are visiting our court as per our [Root.Consort.GetTitle]'s invitation. They can be found discussing all sorts of new theories far into the wee hours of the night. [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has asked us to make the scientist an offer, claiming that she would make a much better advisor than the [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] we currently employ.
consort_events.312.db코0=Most [Root.Consort.GetTitle]s accept their limited power and devote their lives to various pastimes and their family, but not [Root.Consort.GetName]. [Root.Consort.GetSheHeCap] is genuinely interested in all the ins and outs of governmental matters. Over the years [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has befriended many great thinkers, politicians and diplomats. Among them is one of our most well-known statesmen, with whom [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has spent a lot of time with as of late. Now [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has asked us to make the statesman an offer, claiming that he would make a much better advisor than the [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] we currently employ.
consort_events.312.dc코0=No other [Root.Consort.GetTitle] is as brave as our [Root.Consort.GetName]! Military tactics and organization have always been of great interest to [Root.Consort.GetHerHim]. In addition to [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] daily sword practice, [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] spends many hours each day studying the art of war. During the last few months [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] has become better acquainted with one of our most respected commandants, and he in turn has taken our [Root.Consort.GetTitle] under his wing, teaching [Root.Consort.GetName] everything [Root.Consort.GetSheHe] wishes to know. Now [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has asked us to make the commandant an offer, claiming that he would make a much better advisor than the [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] we currently employ.
consort_events.312.a코0=[Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] has a point! We shall invite [Root.Consort.GetHerHis] acquaintance to stay.

consort_events.313.d코0=In these dark days of war and death, a reminder of new beginnings can ease the pains of our people. Our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] noble [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName] have been blessed with another child. The arrival of the babe has brought new hope and energy to the royal couple, and by extension, to their court and subjects. Many people dream that this child will grow up in a better, brighter future, and that all the fighting will thus be worth it in the end.
consort_events.313.a코0=Blessed be [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Consort.GetName] and their new babe!
consort_events.313.a.tt코0=The birth of the new [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] babe revitalizes the people of [Root.GetName].
consort_events.314.t코0=Desires of the Flesh
consort_events.314.da코0=While we have successfully managed to keep the truth from the rest of the court, it is only a question of time until it gets out unless we do something. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] recently discovered that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Consort.GetWifeHusband], [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName], is having an affair! Not only that, but the other guilty culprit is none other than our advisor [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]. The trust we put in [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] was obviously unfounded. Even worse, this also raises questions concerning the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s [Root.Heir.GetDaughterSon], [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName].

consort_events.314.a코0=Now we know, at least. We can take measures to keep this quiet.
consort_events.314.a.tt코0=Allow the affair between [Root.Consort.GetTitle] §Y[Root.Consort.GetName]§! and the [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] §Y[Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]§! to continue, while doing our best to keep it from the public eye.

consort_events.315.d코0=We tried to stop the rumors, but when we were made aware of them it was already too late. Now every other man and woman at court is gossiping behind our backs. Even the commoners in the streets have the nerves to make lewd jokes about 'the friendly [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName]' and 'the bastard of [Root.Capital.GetName]'. They say that the Queen is an adulteress and that [Root.Heir.GetName], the heir of [Root.GetName], is not actually the [Root.Heir.GetDaughterSon] of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. All we can do at this point is keeping up appearances as best we can and hope that the rumors will die down in time.

revolutionary_republic_factions.0.t코0=Turmoil in the Army
revolutionary_republic_factions.0.d코0=Breaking the chains of the old regime has finally freed the top of the officer corps from the restraining links between birth and promotion. No doubt our army will soon be lead by men of merit that will outclass the old crops of aristocrats. Right now, however, the sudden lack of experienced officers at the top as well as the great influx of new recruits at the bottom has led to a somewhat volatile atmosphere in our ranks. Patriotism and revolutionary fervor is a strong motivator but without able leadership any army can find itself unable to perform to expectations.

revolutionary_republic_factions.1.t코0=For the lack of a cord...
revolutionary_republic_factions.1.d코1=The old regime was always tightly tied to the power of the clergy and the fear of the divine is one of the ways to control the people that our radicals hate the most. Therefore the confiscation of religious property and the requirement for all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to a Civil Constitution have been high on the agenda for many in the National Assembly. Outside the radicals not everyone in the assembly agrees on the best course of action and our policy has wavered a bit over time. Atheism is not always the most popular with the masses and especially in the countryside our actions against local priests have been met with contempt.\nPerhaps it could be beneficial to scale back our radicalism a bit without abandoning the long term goal of freeing society from religion?
revolutionary_republic_factions.1.a코0=We cannot betray our ideology!
revolutionary_republic_factions.1.b코0=The clergy can be useful to uphold order.
revolutionary_republic_factions.1.c코0=We can give some leeway here.
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.t코0=The Favor of the Mob
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.d코2=The poor and destitute people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have in many ways been empowered by the revolution far more than other groups in our [Root.GovernmentName]. While the goal is to break the chains of the old order for all those who have been oppressed for so long the citizens of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are close to the seat of power and can make their will known to their representatives directly. Some even fear the will of what they consider to be an unruly mob which changes its loyalty on a whim. Others stress that this 'mob' is a direct manifestation of the will of the people and that we would all do well to listen to it.
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.a코0=They need someone to speak for them!
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.a.tt코0=By empowering and flattering the common people [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] we will strengthen the popularity of our government.
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.b코0=To the army!
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.b.tt코0=We will harness the patriotism of the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by enlisting them in the ranks of our grand army. The revolution must be spread abroad!
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.c코0=We cannot let fear govern this great country.
revolutionary_republic_factions.2.c.tt코0=We will empower those that want to curtail the power of the masses in order to restore order and authority to our fair Republic.
revolutionary_republic_factions.3.t코0=Wavering Loyalty
revolutionary_republic_factions.3.da코0=Ideological convictions can change and sometimes personal rivalries leave even high officials disillusioned with their former comrades in arms. A high ranking official of previous governments has recently gone over to those who he would formerly have considered his sworn enemies. With him he takes some of the dirtiest secrets of the $RR_GIRONDISTS$ and a fervent will to harm their influence in general and in the National Assembly in particular.

revolutionary_republic_factions.3.a코0=Interesting.
revolutionary_republic_factions.4.t코0=Enemies of the Revolution
revolutionary_republic_factions.4.d코0=The enemies of the revolution are everywhere, even in our own midst. We cannot allow the nobles, priests and various representatives of the old order to go on as if nothing has happened. We must act swiftly and deliberately to squash any unrevolutionary behavior or suspicion of monarchism. To this end the $RR_JACOBINS$ have had the foresight to establish a court where the people can give their judgement on where we can find friends and foes. Who would be more suitable to identify the enemies of the revolution than the common citizens and citizenesses of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]?
revolutionary_republic_factions.4.a코0=Equality, Liberty, Fraternity or Death!
revolutionary_republic_factions.5.t코0=Consolidation of Power
revolutionary_republic_factions.5.d코0=Ever since having been elected the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been seeking to consolidate power. Various men of ambition have been either replaced or propped up, the members of the national assembly have been circumvented, marginalized and outmaneuvered at any possible opportunity. The people on the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are somewhat apprehensive of this activity but the presence of loyal troops and the support of the countryside population is keeping [Root.GetName] an unusually quiet and orderly country. For now.
revolutionary_republic_factions.5.a코0=Liberty and Public Order!
revolutionary_republic_factions.6.t코0=A Constitution for [Root.GetName]
revolutionary_republic_factions.6.d코0=While they have primarily come to be seen as the proponents of spreading the revolution abroad through military actions, $RR_GIRONDISTS$ are also in many ways the voice of the establishment. Now that they have achieved considerable influence in the National Assembly they are using that power to attempt to create a formalized set of rules, a constitution for our new country. This is not the first project of its kind and likely not the last but they hope it will bring us one step closer to a new order and an age of Liberalism, Equality and Brotherhood.
revolutionary_republic_factions.6.a코0=Long live the Republic!
revolutionary_republic_factions.7.t코0=Lack of Administrators
revolutionary_republic_factions.7.d코0=Crushing the old order has brought unparalleled justice and equality to the masses as well as substantial assets into the state treasury. It has, however, also meant a loss of experienced administrators, bureaucrats and clerics. $RR_GIRONDISTS$ have quickly become the faction of many of the various remaining members of the old establishment and while they claim to support the revolution in every principle they are dismayed by the direction things have taken lately. Many of these sons of lesser nobility, the old clergy and other privileged classes have withdrawn from public life and are leaving the country fearing for their lives.\nThis has left us with a state that has more to administrate but fewer people with the required experience to do so. With merit as the guiding principle of government we are certain to find new able citizens to take their place but this has still placed us in a bit of a situation for the time being.
revolutionary_republic_factions.7.a코0=This is a small price to pay for the furtherment of Man.
revolutionary_republic_factions.7.b코0=Let us try to get at least some of them to stay.
revolutionary_republic_factions.8.t코0=Popular Generals
revolutionary_republic_factions.8.d코2=The foremost protector of our [Root.GovernmentName] and the values of the Revolution is our army. Unlike the representatives of the old order our ranks are filled by ordinary citizens fuelled by their burning patriotism and liberal convictions. A life in the army can also bring the most disparate people together and create strong bonds between the soldiers and their officers.\nThe popularity of some of our generals have now reached somewhat frightening levels and there are fears in the National Assembly that this will spread to the general populace due to our wide recruitment policies. We could try curtailing some of the more obviously dangerous men by giving them assignments out of our way but this would likely strengthen their supporters in their conviction of our own incompetence, at least in the short run.
revolutionary_republic_factions.8.a코0=This is inevitable but harmless.
revolutionary_republic_factions.8.b코0=Attempt to curtail some of the more threatening leaders.
revolutionary_republic_factions.9.t코0=[GetMonth] Massacres
revolutionary_republic_factions.9.d코1=Fearing the influence of crypto-monarchists and counter-revolutionaries among the ruling elite, the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have taken to the streets to defend the spirit of the revolution. Everyone associated with the old order, from [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] priests, to members of the lesser nobility, or even those already imprisoned for their crimes against the state have been targeted. Radical $RR_JACOBINS$ do their best to inflame the hearts and minds of the masses.\nThis leaves the government in a somewhat precarious situation. Some of the persons being targeted are members of their own ranks, and these uncontrolled massacres are making us appear weak, as it severely harms the well-being of our once beautiful city. Should we do anything to stop it, however, it will play right into the hands of the Jacobins...
