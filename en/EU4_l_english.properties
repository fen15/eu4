rajput_musketeerDESCR코0=As the development of firearms progressed the equipment of Indian musketmen increased in quality. Precision and long range was given priority as the Mughals would continue to use musketeers as sharpshooters or marksmen. The Mughals would also continue the use of musketeers in the direct service of the central authority (as opposed to the cavalry arm in the hands of the Mansabdars).
reformed_mughal_mansabdarDESCR코0=The Sikhs of the Punjab would develop a special kind of cavalry fighting style inspired by the Persian and Afghan armies. This was referred to as 'dhai-phat' or 'two-and-a-half' strikes. A group of cavalry would ride up to the enemy and fire their matchlocks, retreat and repeat. When the enemy was sufficiently softened the great mass of the cavalry charged with their sabers. Similarly many north Indian states increasingly came to incorporate mobile musket-armed cavalry troopers in their armies, often recruited from the many Afghan tribesmen in the region.
indian_shock_cavalryDESCR코0=The Western Deccan, an area of hills, jungles and many forts proved quite hard to subdue for the large and heavily equipped Mughal armies. In its desperate fight to survive the Ahmednagar sultanate pioneered the use of light cavalry to harass the Mughal forces. The Maratha horsemen employed by Ahmednagar were so successful that they were soon employed by other rulers as well.
bhonsle_infantryDESCR코0=Many tribesmen of the Kanara, Desh and Malnad regions, such as the Berads and Mavales, adopted matchlock muskets for hunting and warfare early on. Due to their familiarity with the weapons these tribesmen soon became the primary musketmen in southern India. The Maratha armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Maratha, Mughal and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area.
indian_archersDESCR코0=While Elephants were a common element in most Indian armies they would often only be used in smaller numbers by commanders and as a supplement to the cavalry or infantry. In the regions dominated by jungle however, such as Orissa or Bastar, horses are both hard to use effectively and to keep in good health. As a result armies in these regions would rely much more on larger units of elephants used as mobile archer platforms.
indian_arquebusierDESCR코0=With the general lack of interest in the development of infantry tactics in Indian armies the advent of fire arms would at first not make a big impact. While common in Indian armies they would not make up a sizable part of the infantry troops for a long time and firearms would continue to be used in an individual way rather than adopted for specific formations. Rather than equipping their own units with the new weapons the Indian states would initially be content to hire foreign, often Turkoman, arquebusiers as a supplement to their archers and artillery.
rajput_hill_fightersDESCR코0=With the arrival of Muslim powers came an increased influx of good foreign cavalry mounts to India. The use of Muslim military tactics eventually became commonplace even in the armies of Hindu states such as the Vijayanagara Empire. In the north-west the Rajput warriors quickly adapted to the tactics of the Indian sultanates and a new breed of Rajput cavalry horses also soon emerged. The care and breeding of these Marwari horses would take on a highly ceremonial and revered role in the highly militant Rajput societies. In the southern Indian climate breeding cavalry mounts proved harder and south Indian rulers found themselves having to rely on the traders of the Indian Ocean to supply their cavalry.
mughal_mansabdarDESCR코0=Throughout the 15th century cavalry continued to be the most influential of the combat arms in India. The arrival of Babur in the early 16th century and the birth of the Mughal Empire came to further accentuate this trend. Babur made use of large contingents of cavalry archers from the steppes of Transoxiana during his invasion and the Mughals who came after him would continue to rely on a large cavalry arm. As the other states in northern India tried to catch up with the Mughal military machine many of them came to rely increasingly on the use of Central Asian adventurers as cavalry officers. One of these Afghan adventurers would come to found the short-lived Suri Empire in eastern and central India.
tipu_sultan_rocketDESCR코0=As the 18th century progressed Indian infantry came to fight more coordinated, with a higher rate of fire and be put to much better use than before. The addition of military innovations such as Mysorean rockets and the integration of Indian light cavalry allowed Indian states to be much more successful against European armies. Striking a good balance at this, Mysore in particular would, under Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan, come to propel itself from a local kingdom to a regional South Indian power.
indian_footsoldierDESCR코0=In Indian military history the infantry was often cheap to come by and easy to replace due to the large Indian population. Cavalry on the other hand was expensive and had often, at least since the arrival of the Muslim armies in the 13th century, proved to be the decisive element on Indian battlefields. Perhaps because of this the development of infantry tactics would not receive as much attention during most of the early modern era. The role of the infantry was to make up the bulk of a force and to siege the many forts of the Indian subcontinent.
indian_elephantDESCR코0=As the Mughal empire grew the need for a central organization to keep track of its many power holders became a necessity. Under Akbar a numerical ranking system for all nobles (Mansabdars) was implemented. Jagirs, allowances and the number of cavalry troopers a noble was obliged to field, would become dependent on this rank.
mughal_musketeerDESCR코2=With Babur's invasion of India the subcontinent saw its first organized use of fire arms. Unlike in the west, however, the musketmen, or Toofangchis, as used by Babur would serve as marksmen in his armies, firing individually at specific targets both during pitched battles and sieges. Babur took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Mughal cavalry arm the recruitment, training and organization of musketmen would be kept under his direct control. Whether Babur's great success at Panipat was due to the use of fire arms or not the use of musketmen became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after Babur's invasion.
maharathan_cavalryDESCR코0=After the fall of the Ahmednagar sultanate the Marathas that had previously thrived in its service came to fight in the service of Bijapur and other local or regional powers eager to develop further ways to outsmart the large Mughal armies encroaching on the Deccan. With the rise of Maratha military ability came the rise of Maratha political power and these Deccani warriors would soon form states of their own, overshadowing their former Muslim employers and proving to be a threat to their Mughal nemesis. Through the use of light cavalry and infantry the Marathan armies would be able to harass and cut off much larger and less mobile Mughal forces and carve out a number of empires from the declining Mughal state.
sikh_rifleDESCR코0=Hiring of European officers to train and lead Indian regiments changed the military landscape of India in many ways. Armies using traditional tactics, emphasizing cavalry, were often beaten by forces with drilled musket-armed infantry and mobile artillery. In order to stay ahead it would become essential to organize cavalry, infantry and artillery to fight together to a much greater degree than had previously been seen in India. Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan was one of the states that took this lesson to heart the most and managed to prove that as long as they could be properly coordinated with the other arms light cavalry was still a very powerful tool for disrupting the operations of their opponents in India.
south_indian_musketeerDESCR코0=Vijayanagara and its successor states relied on the local chiefs of the communities of their empire for much of its administration. Among their tasks was the organization of local defense and the recruitment and marshaling of troops.
sikh_hit_and_runDESCR코0=The less prestigious infantry arm would commonly attract third or fourth sons of poor Purbia Rajput families in the northern countryside, deserted Afghan clansmen, Jat farmers, and other groups with poor prospects. Unable to afford horses these groups would adopt the use of firearms as a cheaper way to succeed in the battlefield. While they were given little formal training these self-educated Purbia musketmen would eventually make up the core of a more modern northern Indian army as their use of firearms and eventual use of more modern European infantry tactics allowed them to increasingly make a difference on the battlefields of India.
indian_rifleDESCR코0=The role that the Telingas and Berads filled in the south would eventually be filled by the Purbias in the north. British officers in the service of the East India Company and French adventurers in the service of the Mughals or other Indian rulers became increasingly common as commanders of Indian musket infantry in the north-east. As a result drilled Indian infantry regiments could soon be found in all the armies of the states in the north as well as in mercenary bands. Eventually recruitment would become even more organized and these northern Indian troops, known as Sepoys after the Mughal term for an infantryman would become closely associated with Company rule in India.
reformed_mughal_musketeerDESCR코0=As the Vijayanagara empire fractured into a number of Nayak kingdoms following its defeat at Talicota the local Poligars remained in place as local power holders responsible for recruitment. In some of these successor states the Poligars would acquire an even more independent position than they had under Vijayanagara. Along with the continued shortage of horses this led to an even bigger infantry ratio in the southern armies. Firearms also continued to become more common in the south as well as in the north during the 16th century.
bhonsle_cavalryDESCR코0=The light Maratha cavalry increasingly proved how vulnerable the grand Mughal heavy cavalry armies were if you could cut off their supplies. During the first half of the 18th century as Maratha power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s.
maharathan_guerilla_warfareDESCR코0=As the French became increasingly entangled in the affairs of the south and eastern Indian states they started the practice of training Indian troops to use coordinated European infantry tactics. This would soon prove to be the start of a revolution in Indian warfare as infantry rather than cavalry increasingly came to be the determining factor in battles. Under Dupleix and de Bussy Telegu soldiers started to fight and arm themselves in a manner more similar to the European armies of the time. These troops were known as Telingas after their area of origin (Telingana) but soon the term came to be used about musket armed and uniformed infantry troops in other parts of India.

random_event.EVTDESC20코0=A delegation from the Five Nations of the Iroquois has made the arduous oversea journey and arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] intending to form an alliance with us, and have unintentionally become a sensation. Our commoners wave and cheer as they ride our streets in royal carriages and our nobles compete for the privilege of entertaining these 'Four Kings' of the Mohawks.\n\nThey cast an imposing figure, much taller than our average man and they wear black breeches, vests, and stockings and over this they all wear scarlet cloaks trimmed with gold. They have dark skin, dark eyes and fantastic tattoos like we've never seen before. They do not speak our tongue, but after an exchange of gifts they had a speech read on their behalf, asking for better relations and help against our common enemies, telling us of their plight and bringing some members of our court to tears. They have made quite an impression.
random_event.EVTOPTA20코0=Give them a chain of steel representing our unbreakable bond

random_event.EVTNAME22코0=Establish Penal Colony in [Root.GetName]
random_event.EVTDESC22코0=Our colony in [Root.GetName] has not been progressing as quickly as we would like. One of your advisors has, however, come up with a plan to speed up growth. They are proposing that we send thieves, debtors and other criminals to [Root.GetName] and have them pay their debts to society by working to develop the colony and eventually become settlers once their sentence is done. While this plan might seem good on paper there is a chance a rebellion may occur due to having all these dangerous individuals in a single location.

colonial_nation.EVTNAME300코0=Ban Fur Trade
colonial_nation.EVTDESC300코0=The people in [Root.GetName] are too friendly with the Indians. A proposal has been put forward for a ban on all private trading with Indians, including the death penalty for anyone caught teaching an Indian how to fire a gun. This new law will injure the local economy of both the Indians and the local population but will ensure our security from armed Indian raids.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA300코0=Approve the law
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB300코0=Ignore the issue
colonial_nation.EVTNAME301코0=The Harvest of [GetYear]
colonial_nation.EVTDESC301코0=The crop harvest in [Root.GetName] has been very poor this year and the shortage of food is already felt across the colony. The prices are soaring and some predict a harsh winter might be coming. The nearby Indians have found out about our difficult situation and have volunteered some of their food supplies. What they brought isn't nearly enough to sustain us through the winter, but there must be more corn where the gift came from. Some propose that we send soldiers to the Indian villages and seize their food.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA301코0=Take what we need
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB301코0=We will solve this ourselves
colonial_nation.EVTNAME302코0=Wage Laws for Builders
colonial_nation.EVTDESC302코0=The prices of construction are going up because skilled labor is in shortage as new colonists flowing into the colony greatly demand their services. A proposal has been put forth that a maximum wage should be set across [Root.GetName] for all carpenters, sawyers, masons and bricklayers. The price will be set at fair levels, and everyone demanding higher payment or offering to pay more for construction work would be subject to a penalty. How do we vote?
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA302코0=Vote yes, it's a sound idea
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB302코0=We don't need to regulate that
colonial_nation.EVTNAME303코0=Iron Discovered
colonial_nation.EVTDESC303코0=To sustain ourselves, [Root.Owner.GetName] must seek new sources of revenue and reduce our dependence on imports. A great opportunity has presented itself though, as bog iron ore has been discovered in [Root.GetName]! The proposition is to mandate the owner to construct a furnace and a forge and immediately begin production. In exchange the owner will be guaranteed a 10-year-long tax break to subsidize the initial cost.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA303코0=Sounds like a good opportunity
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB303코0=No, thanks
colonial_nation.EVTNAME304코0=Domestic Wool Industry
colonial_nation.EVTDESC304코0=The dwindling profits of the colonial trade and our reliance on imported goods are starting to hurt [Root.Owner.GetName]. We must seek economic independence from imports and for that end a new proposal has been presented. By outlawing exports of sheep and ordering more wool to be produced locally we'll ensure enough warm clothes are being offered to the colonists. For this a Textile Manufactory should be started in [Root.GetName].
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA304코0=Sounds like a good opportunity
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB304코0=No, thanks
colonial_nation.EVTNAME305코0=A Wharf Needed
colonial_nation.EVTDESC305코0=If [Root.Owner.GetName] wants to become less dependent on [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName] and move towards self-sufficiency, we need to be able to secure enough salt and naval supplies. A prominent citizen living in [Root.GetCapitalName] has assured us that with a little help he could construct a new Wharf in [Root.GetName]. In exchange for his investment he asks for 10 years of subsidies.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA305코0=Sounds like a good opportunity
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB305코0=No, thanks
colonial_nation.EVTNAME306코0=Cash Crop Ban
colonial_nation.EVTDESC306코0=Unlike the founders of [Root.Owner.GetName], new settlers tend to be short-sighted and put profits ahead of securing the future existence of themselves and their families. They ignore the necessity to produce food for the colony and go straight for cash crop believing that they will be able to sell it and purchase food from other farmers. If this continues, our colony will eventually face famine and disorder. To prevent this, a law enforcing that new farmers produce food in at least a part of their fields has been suggested.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA306코0=A law seems necessary
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB306코0=It's none of our business
colonial_nation.EVTNAME307코0=Banned Tobacco Planting
colonial_nation.EVTDESC307코0=When we first arrived here the prices of Tobacco were soaring, and the profits were immense. Now, as more farmers arrive and start their own plantations, the supply of Tobacco has quickly risen and caused the prices in Europe to drop year after year. A proposal has been made by established planters to ban the planting of Tobacco for one year, so prices have time to recover. New farmers are obviously opposing this proposal but we must do what we must do to protect our livelihoods.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA307코0=Enforce it
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB307코0=Reject their proposal
colonial_nation.EVTNAME310코0=Colonial Border Conflict
colonial_nation.EVTDESC310코0=Settlers from another of [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName]'s colonies have breached our borders! In search of resources they have expanded into land part of [Root.GetName] and gotten into conflict with the local population. This cannot be tolerated!
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA310코0=Send the local militia to drive them out!
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB310코0=Let the situation resolve itself
colonial_nation.EVTDESC311코0=In search of new land and resources, settlers from [Root.GetName] have ventured across the border into [From.GetName] which has caused conflicts with the local population there. [From.Owner.GetName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but their militia seems to have gone too far and their mission degenerated into a vengeful raid into [Root.GetName]. This cannot be tolerated!
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA311코0=Send in our local militia as well!
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB311코0=Let the situation resolve itself
colonial_nation.EVTDESC312코0=Sending our militia to drive out the competing settlers from [From.From.GetName] might have been a mistake. Encouraged by their easy success, our troops got carried away and continued into [From.GetName], raiding the border villages there. This has greatly upset [From.Owner.GetName] and they in turn sent their militia into [From.From.GetName]...
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA312코0=Damn them!
colonial_nation.EVTDESC313코0=Sigh... where to begin? It seems that settlers from [From.Owner.GetName] has ventured into [From.From.GetName] - a province of [From.From.Owner.GetName] - in search of new land and resources. [From.From.Owner.GetName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but they got overzealous and pursued the settlers back into [From.GetName], raiding and burning. The conflict then escalated when [From.Owner.GetName] sent their militia to drive out the [From.From.Owner.GetAdjective] militia and carry out raids of their own into [From.From.GetName]...\n\nThe [From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.From.Owner.GetName], [From.From.Owner.Monarch.GetName], is blaming the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], [From.Owner.Monarch.GetName], and vice versa. How do we solve this without losing face?

colonial_nation.EVTNAME318코0=Enhanced Colonial Militia
colonial_nation.EVTDESC318코0=The assembly has proposed that we set aside substantial resources to enhance our militia. The colony needs better protection from native attacks and raids from other colonies. It will also strengthen us if we at some point should find ourselves at war with [Root.ColonialParent.GetName].
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA318코0=Establish it
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB318코0=Don't establish it
colonial_nation.EVTNAME319코0=Purchase of Land
colonial_nation.EVTDESC319코0=Settlers in [Root.GetName] are complaining that there are still natives living in parts of the province. This land could be used more effectively if settled and cultivated. They suggest we purchase this land from the local natives.
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA319코0=Good idea
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB319코0=It's too costly
colonial_nation.EVTDESC320코0=To be able to compete with other colonies we must sustain the growth of [Root.GetName]. The natives in a neighboring province have proved willing to sell their lands to us. This seems like an ideal solution.
colonial_nation.EVTNAME321코0=Last of the Mahican
colonial_nation.EVTDESC321코0=A small group of Natives, long since pacified and now decimated by warfare and disease, are seeking to live under the protection of our colony. Though they are few, they can still be of some assistance to us with their knowledge of local ways, and are willing to help us in return for our protection of their village in [Root.GetName]. But their native enemies would look poorly on us...
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA321코0=Offer them protection
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB321코0=Deny them
colonial_nation.EVTNAME322코0=The [Root.GetName] Boys
colonial_nation.EVTDESC322코0=News of native assaults on our people along the frontiers have spread across the colony. Reasoning that all natives are somehow allied and cannot in any event be trusted, an angry armed mob has descended on the peaceful remnant of the Mahican living in [Root.GetName]. Only a handful, the very last of their people, remains, and the mob, against whom no one will testify, remains at large...
colonial_nation.EVTOPTA322코0=Protect the remnant at all cost
colonial_nation.EVTOPTB322코0=We cannot save them...
colonial_nation.EVTNAME323코0=The Last to Die
colonial_nation.EVTDESC323코0=Years ago, we granted our protection to the last remnant of the Mahican tribe. In the years since, disease and war have made further ravages, until at last only one remained - the last of his people. He was a faithful ally, guiding our people in battle and helping our colonists, but the laws of life are harsh, and now he too, has passed on.

But since it is impossible to know who is predestined, a notion has developed that it might be possible to discern that a person is predestined by observing their way of life. As hard work, frugality, social success and wealth are thought to be important consequences of being predestined, it seems to inspire followers of the Reformed faith to strive for reaching them, as well as attracting those who already possess them - like burghers and merchants.
