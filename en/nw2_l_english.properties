flavor_hun.10.t코0=The Hungarian Throne
flavor_hun.10.d코0=The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has suddenly died, rather suspiciously, leaving the throne vacant. The [From.GetAdjective] Diet has ignored that their former [From.Monarch.GetTitle] belonged to the Habsburg dynasty and elected their own [From.Monarch.GetTitle], completely ignoring our legitimate claim to the throne.
flavor_hun.10.a코0=War is the continuation of politics by other means...
colonial.EVTDESC20코0=These so called pilgrims from [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName] are following the [heretics_from_here.Religion.GetName] faith, which is an abomination to the [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetAdjective] [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.Religion.GetName] church. In the hopes of finding a more tolerant society in the New World, they have settled in [Root.GetName].

In the hopes of finding a more tolerant society in the New World, they have settled in [Root.GetName].
flavor_fra.EVTNAME100코0=The Infernal Machine
flavor_fra.EVTDESC100코1=There has been an attempt on the life of our beloved [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! The royalist conspirators concealed their bomb in a barrel on a cart parked on the Rue Saint-Nicaise, where Napoléon had to pass on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' Nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', the bomb was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoléon.
flavor_fra.EVTOPTA100코1=A lucky escape.
flavor_fra.EVTNAME101코0=Aspirations of an Empire
flavor_fra.EVTDESC101코2=Not satisfied with being merely First Consul, Napoléon Bonaparte is proposing that he be crowned Emperor of the French. He justifies this by claiming that restoring the hereditary succession would make it harder to restore the former kings of France to power - after all, there have been several royalist plots on his life - but there is little doubt that his prime motivation is to further his own ambitions for supreme power. The proposal has met with widespread support among the populace, who yearn for the relative stability of the pre-revolutionary years; however, diehard supporters of the Revolution express worry at this attempt to concentrate even more power in Napoléon's hands.
flavor_fra.EVTOPTA101코0=France will be an Empire!
flavor_fra.EVTOPTB101코0=The Revolution must continue!
flavor_fra.EVTNAME110코0=The Revolutionary Republic
flavor_fra.EVTDESC110코1=The wars of [Root.GetName] are a never-ending drain on the country's people. As the Republic's wars exact an ever greater toll on the commoners in the shape of high taxes, conscription and mounting death tolls, many of those who hoped their situation would be improved by the Revolution are now deceased and those who thought that the change of government would bring peace to the country seem to have lost faith in the republic.
flavor_fra.EVTOPTA110코0=The republic will survive!
flavor_fra.EVTDESC111코1=Constant warfare has exhausted the population of [Root.GetName]. Those who supported the Revolution complain that they had sought to better their position, not subject themselves to a constant state of war that is having devastating effects on the general populace. Many are increasingly losing faith in the Republic as a result.
flavor_fra.EVTDESC112코0=The change of government only seems to have increased the financial mismanagement. With the Republic of [Root.GetName] having declared bankruptcy, many of its former supporters now ask themselves if things weren't perhaps better before the Revolution...
flavor_fra.EVTDESC113코1=The national debt is a problem in the eyes of the people. The country's finances seem to be in no better shape than before the shift of government, and many fear a costly default or rising taxes. The faith in the Republic is dwindling and many are turning back to old monarchist ways.
flavor_fra.EVTDESC114코1=The Revolution seems to have ground to a halt. With more than a quarter of the country in revolt, few now believe that the republican government holds the answers to our nation's problems.
flavor_fra.EVTDESC115코1=Those who thought that the Revolution and the Republic would be the answers to the instability of [Root.GetName] are becoming more and more disillusioned. The ever-increasing turmoil afflicting our nation is causing widespread suffering among the peasantry and upper classes alike. Support is growing for a strong leader to take over control and enforce an end to the chaos.
flavor_fra.EVTDESC116코1=The People's faith in the Republic is declining. They accuse us of putting too little effort into mending the problems of the old regime and claim that things were better off for them before the Revolution. Already, dissidents are rallying support behind those who wish to reverse our course and place a monarch on the [Root.GetAdjective] throne.

religious_events.16.t코0=Opposition to [Root.Monarch.GetName]
religious_events.16.d코1=The sizeable Muslim community of [Root.GetName] has been raising objections to the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the old Muslim aristocrats and clergy remain very influential in our country and still hold many positions of power within our state this is not a small problem. It has been suggested that perhaps the situation might be defused by [Root.Monarch.GetName] abdicating in favor of a relative who would then convert to Islam. This would allow power to remain with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family while still placating the Ulema and leading aristocrats. Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] to continue to govern our country we may find that these elements within our state are likely to attempt to enthrone a candidate of their own with more favorable attitudes towards Islam.

canal_events.EVTDESC11코0=It seems that the privately owned canal company that was set up a few years ago has gone bankrupt. They apparently faced severe economic problems early on, but hid this information from the public and deceived investors into sinking more and more money into the project. Many have been ruined by what is now commonly called the 'canal scheme' and angry mobs are gathering in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName], demanding justice and economic retribution.
canal_events.EVTOPTA11코0=It is not our fault!
canal_events.EVTOPTB11코0=Let's foot the bill...
canal_events.EVTNAME12코0=Good Leadership?
canal_events.EVTDESC12코0=Amazingly, it looks like our canal project in [Root.GetName] has progressed ahead of its schedule!

canal_events.EVTOPTB20코0=Pray and hope for the best
canal_events.EVTNAME21코0=Outbreak of Illness
canal_events.EVTDESC21코0=An outbreak of illness has struck our canal project in [Root.GetName]! The reports mention sudden coldness and shivering followed by fever and cases of vomiting, convulsions and damages to the eyes.

canal_events.EVTOPTB22코0=There is nothing we can do
canal_events.EVTNAME23코0=Canal Crossing River
canal_events.EVTDESC23코0=Another problem to overcome for our canal project in [Root.GetName]: a local river is crossing the path of the canal.

So we need to divert the whole river...
canal_events.EVTOPTA23코0=Hire more workers
canal_events.EVTOPTB23코0=Send soldiers
canal_events.EVTNAME24코0=Lack of Fresh Water

All conspirators were convicted, sentenced to death and beheaded by the order of the governor. This incident has naturally stirred up quite the reaction though...
