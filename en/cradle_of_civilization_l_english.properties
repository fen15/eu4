desc_efficient_tax_farming_modifier코0=Tax farms are in many ways the most efficient way to exploit the resources of our country. By selling the right to extract profit from various parts of our domain we can be sure of a steady and guaranteed income, while the tax farmer himself has good incentive to make the land yield even more.

ideagroups.111.b코0=Let us do what we can to realize these ideas!
army_professionalism_events.1.t코0=Sack of [From.GetCapitalName]
army_professionalism_events.1.d코0=Traditionally advancing armies have been expected to supply themselves from what they can plunder in the area they move through. This is often the only way for soldiers to survive in wartime as payments from the [Root.GovernmentName] treasury can rarely be brought in a timely manner to the men. In fact, by paying retroactively many also avoid the strain of paying for the fallen.\nAs [From.GetCapitalName] fell it was therefore expected that our soldiers be allowed to loot the city to enrich themselves. What was less expected was the total and utter destruction of the city that took place. Refusing to follow orders our men descended upon the helpless burghers, doing despicable things and ruining the area for a long time to come.
army_professionalism_events.1.a코0=We must punish the perpetrators!
army_professionalism_events.1.b코0=We need better payment routines and harder discipline!
army_professionalism_events.1.c코0=Such are the rules of warfare.
army_professionalism_events.2.t코0=[Root.GetCapitalName] Looted!
army_professionalism_events.2.d코0=Following the fall of [Root.GetCapitalName], the armies of [From.GetName] have devastated the city and the surrounding countryside.
army_professionalism_events.2.a코0=Barbarians!
army_professionalism_events.3.t코0=The Sack of [Root.GetCapitalName]
army_professionalism_events.3.d코1=As the city of [Root.GetCapitalName] fell into enemy hands, the advancing armies of [From.GetAdjective] embarked on several days of plundering. Inside the city walls a smoldering ruin is all that remains of the once thriving city and the survivors are seeking refuge as far away as they can.
army_professionalism_events.3.a코0=Our people will never forget the atrocities of [From.GetName]!
army_professionalism_events.4.t코0=Delayed Salaries
army_professionalism_events.4.d코0=The campaign in [enemy_country.GetName] has run into some severe logistical problems. As the season for salary payment draws nearer, it is becoming abundantly clear that we will not be able to pay all troops as there is simply no way for the money to get to them on time. Our generals blame constant enemy raids on the baggage train and insist they planned everything in detail, but the problem is now [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s to solve.\nIf we only pay a fraction of our troops many will no doubt desert.\nWe could also choose to pay none of them and tell them to live off the land, but that would likely devastate the entire area.
army_professionalism_events.4.a코0=We must pay the elite troops
army_professionalism_events.4.b코0=Let them live off the land
army_professionalism_events.5.t코0=The many jobs of a Soldier
army_professionalism_events.5.d코0=Prolonged peacetime and changes in the economy has lead to many of our salaried soldiers no longer considering the pensions we pay them sufficient. An increasing number of them have turned to other daily work such as shopkeeping or craftsmanship, earning a better living in their city homes.\nWhile this can stimulate the local economy it does mean that these troopers are no longer maintaining, or practicing with, the equipment we have provided them. In order to stop this trend, we would have to increase their pay substantially.
army_professionalism_events.5.a코0=They must not be allowed to do dabble in the roles other occupations.
army_professionalism_events.5.b코0=We will allow it for now.
army_professionalism_events.6.t코0=Foreign Talent
army_professionalism_events.6.d코0=Our drillmasters stand in awe of the [professional_country.GetAdjective] armies and the methods they have so successfully employed to organize army routines and practices. We are not the only ones who have taken notice, [professional_country.GetAdjective] officers are in high demand in many countries. Of course the [professional_country.GetStateForm] of [professional_country.GetName] does not take kindly upon those of its officers that would seek employment abroad and would likely disapprove if we tried to entice any subject of theirs.\nThat does not mean, however, that there are not individuals who would be interested in such a career opportunity, if we made it worth their while.
army_professionalism_events.6.a코0=Hire [professional_country.GetAdjective] officers
army_professionalism_events.6.b코0=Let us continue to rely on our own people.
army_professionalism_events.7.t코0=Infiltration of [From.GetName]
army_professionalism_events.7.d코1=Our military professionalism has made our retired deserting officers very attractive to the other countries in the region. So much so that they are not properly vetting the defectors they recruit.\nOur spymaster reports that we have managed to get a number of agents into the service of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.GetStateForm].
army_professionalism_events.7.a코0=Excellent...
army_professionalism_events.8.t코0=Wargames
army_professionalism_events.8.d코0=Our generals have asked us for funds to conduct a massive military field exercise to re-enact one of the great [Root.GetOldEra] battles. This would be quite costly, and take up a lot of their time, but they insist it would both provide valuable insights to them, be a good way to drill the troops and perhaps intimidate our neighbors as well.
army_professionalism_events.8.a코0=Allow them to re-enact the battle.
army_professionalism_events.8.b코0=We will soon give them a real war to try their theories in.
army_professionalism_events.9.t코0=Private Contractors
army_professionalism_events.9.d코0=Due to lack of permanent structures many armies rely on private contractors to provide everything from equipment to entire regiments. Usually these entrepreneurs receive a sum in advance that they can then use to procure what the army needs on short notice. This often works well to meet the swiftly changing needs of our troops during campaigns, but there are those that would take advantage of the system.\nAs our armies in [enemy_country.GetName] advance deeper into enemy territory there are increasing reports of corruption and unwarranted cooperation between our logistical officers and local entrepreneurs. If we are to maintain efficiency we must root out these practices, but in the short run we will risk disrupting the system even more by fighting the corruption.
army_professionalism_events.9.a코0=Root out the rot!
army_professionalism_events.9.b코0=We will have to let it be.
army_professionalism_events.10.t코0=An Army Career
army_professionalism_events.10.d코0=With the growth of our professional army, new career opportunities abound for those with ability and ambition. The old [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments], however, still expect to be awarded all the most valuable commissions out of tradition and the centuries during which their lineages have served the [Root.GetStateForm] faithfully.\nSome of our higher officers are now imploring us to open more opportunities for able men to rise in the ranks, while others oppose this vehemently and maintain that there are qualities only blood can assure.
army_professionalism_events.10.a코0=We must safeguard the ancient traditions of our officer corps.
army_professionalism_events.10.b코0=We can make room for newcomers in the higher parts of the hierarchy.
army_professionalism_events.11.t코0=Esprit de Corps
army_professionalism_events.11.d코1=The strain that the military lifestyle puts the men who serve under can, under good circumstances, lead to the development of a spirit of belonging and cooperation that greatly strengthens the armed forces. During the recent conflict with [enemy_country.GetName], we have seen clear signs that our troops are working better together, and that they have formed strong bonds of loyalty and duty to the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetStateForm] that would have seemed hard to imagine just a few years ago.
army_professionalism_events.11.a코0=This is what separates the [Root.GetAdjective] troops from all other.
army_professionalism_events.12.t코0=Lack of Officers
army_professionalism_events.12.d코0=In order to keep a sizable professional army efficient, a sufficient number of trained officers are required to carry out the orders and will of the [Root.GetStateForm]. However, the increased demand on quality leadership is not matched by the number of officers on our rolls.\nWith increased demands on quality, new officers also take longer to train and are harder to recruit.
army_professionalism_events.12.a코0=Shorten the training.
army_professionalism_events.12.b코1=We shall overcome this in time.
army_professionalism_events.13.t코0=Local Militias
army_professionalism_events.13.d코0=Many military duties are not performed by the professional armies of the [Root.GetStateForm] but rather by local militias based around the cities, castles and forts in the various parts of our country. These militias often know the local area well and provide very good value for money as garrisons, scouts and gatherers of intelligence but their quality as regular troops are very varied to say the least.\nIt has been suggested that we send professional soldiers to at least instruct all militias in the country and that we rely less on them when conducting operations in many areas. This would, according to our generals, lead to an increase in quality and make us less vulnerable to things we cannot control. It would, however, also most likely mean dismissing a great number of our reserve troops.
army_professionalism_events.13.a코0=We need the militias.
army_professionalism_events.13.b코0=Let us not rely on local abilities.
army_professionalism_events.14.t코0=Fires of Industry
army_professionalism_events.14.d코0=The growing needs of our professional army has had a profound effect on the local business in [Root.GetCapitalName]. The manufactories in and around the city can hardly keep up with rising demand and both investors and workers are now flocking from all over our country to [Root.GetName] to expand the business.
army_professionalism_events.14.a코0=The foundries of [Root.GetCapitalName] shall supply the nation!
army_professionalism_events.15.t코0=Growth of Regimental Towns
army_professionalism_events.15.d코0=As the army becomes a way to earn a livelihood for an increasing number of our subjects, the cities that house the army installations and barracks are starting to grow under the supervision of army engineers and renovators. In [Root.GetName] the growth of [Root.GetCapitalName] has come to benefit the entire province.
army_professionalism_events.15.a코0=Great.
army_professionalism_events.16.t코0=Treason against [Root.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][Root.GetName]
army_professionalism_events.16.d코0=Recruitment is out of necessity something that has to be a somewhat decentralized affair. Often it will be entrusted to [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] in the capital, and then they are responsible to turn up a set number of men in the various provinces under our control.\nThis is a system that to some extent relies on trust as the central government is not involved in the details of countryside mustering, and the only form of control we have are the, often sporadic, inspections the army itself conducts. One such inspection in [cheating_rolls.GetName] has unearthed quite a local scandal. The rolls we have for the area is full of fictional names and nobody seems to know what we could actually muster from the region.
army_professionalism_events.16.a코0=This is unfortunate.
army_professionalism_events.16.b코0=We must punish the perpetrator and conduct our own survey.
army_professionalism_events.17.t코0=Proliferation of the Musket
army_professionalism_events.17.d코0=As firearms have grown commonplace our old regiments of elite troops no longer fills the same function as sharpshooters and pioneers. They have done much to develop our armies over time and they will now be dispersed among our other regiments.
army_professionalism_events.17.a코0=Ok.
hanafi_school코0=Hanafi
hanafi_school_desc코0=The Hanafi Madhab is named after Abu Hanifa No'man bin Tabet. The school originated in Kufa and is prominent throughout the Persian and Turkic world, including northern India. Though textual sources in the Quran and Hadiths are given preference, Hanafis have an inclusive view of sources and also employ analogy (Qiya), Istihsan and local customs (Urf) in their jurisprudence. Some view it as the most flexible of the schools.
hanbali_school코1=Hanbali
hanbali_school_desc코1=The Hanbali Madhab is named after Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and champions withholding from any speculative theology, Kalam. Hanbalis maintain that the Quran and Sunnah are the only proper sources of jurisprudence and that they should be interpreted in a literal and traditionalist sense. Though it is accepted as a valid Madhab very few states actively promote the Hanbali school, and it was banned by the Abbasid Caliphs.
maliki_school코0=Maliki
maliki_school_desc코0=The Maliki Madhab is named after Malik Ibn Anas and is prominent in particular throughout North Africa and Iberia. Jurisprudence is primarily based on the work and interpretations of ibn Anas and his student Sahnun as described in the al-Muwatta and the Mudawwanah. One of the foremost centers of learning within the Maliki School is the Great Mosque of Kairouan, near Tunis.
shafii_school코0=Shafi'i
shafii_school_desc코0=The Shafi'i Madhab is named after Imam Al-Shafi'i, and it is prominent in particular among Muslims in Arabia, East Africa and East Asia. It was once the official doctrine of the Seljuk, Ayyubid and Mamluk Sultanates. Unlike other Madhabs the Shafi'i reject Istihsan Istislah as sources of Sharia, instead only relying on what is textually in the Quran or Hadiths.
ismaili_school코0=Ismaili
ismaili_school_desc코0=Ismailism is named after Ismai'l ibn Jafar, the successor of Ja'far al-Sadiq, and was the dominant school of faith in the Fatimid Sultanate but has lost much ground since its fall. Ismailism encompasses a number of increasingly divergent branches, such as the Musta'li and the Nizari and in many ways they focus on the esoteric elements of Shiite faith more than the Jafaris or Zaidis.
jafari_school코0=Jafari
jafari_school_desc코0=The Jafari Madhab is named after Jaf'ar al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam, and it's followers are ‘Twelver' Shias. Twelvers believe that Ali, the successor of Muhammed, was followed by twelve infallible Imams chosen by divine decree. The last of the Imams, al-Mahdi, is expected to return as the savior of mankind, finally enforcing justice and peace in the world.
zaidi_school코0=Zaidi
zaidi_school_desc코0=Zaidis are named after Zaid ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammed's son Ali, and follow his teachings as described in the Majmu' al-Fiqh. Zaidis emphasize justice and human responsibility and descend from those that supported Zaid's original revolt against the Ummayad Caliph. Zaidis entirely reject religious dissimulation as practiced by many Shias and they are prominent in the Yemen highlands.

muslim_school_opinion_events.1.t코0=Mutual Respect between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool]
muslim_school_opinion_events.1.d코0=There have never been any theological differences worth a real conflict between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] schools and both customs often exist side by side.\nThe long-lasting cooperation between the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and the [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] [school_opinion_increase_country.GetAdjective] states has, however, lead to a new era of mutual understanding and respect.
muslim_school_opinion_events.1.a코0=God is great.
muslim_school_opinion_events.2.t코0=Normalization of relations between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and the [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool]
muslim_school_opinion_events.2.d코0=For some time the relationship between the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and the [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] have been strongly colored by distrust and conflict. Some scholars have gone as far as to denounce the theologians of the other school and their followers.\nHowever, tensions have been greatly lessened in recent years and with [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetReligiousSchool] and [school_opinion_increase_country.GetAdjective] [school_opinion_increase_country.GetReligiousSchool] scholars leading the way towards tolerance and coexistence.
muslim_school_opinion_events.2.a코0=God is great.
muslim_school_opinion_events.3.t코0=The Ulema and the [Root.GetAdjective] - [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetAdjective] War
muslim_school_opinion_events.3.d코0=The prolonged conflict between the [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetAdjective] and the [Root.GetAdjective] is starting to spill into the religious realm. Mutual respect and tolerance is on an all time low and [school_opinion_decrease_country.GetReligiousSchool] thought is being marginalized in [Root.GetAdjective] society.
muslim_school_opinion_events.3.a코0=Outrageous.
muslim_school_events.1.t코0=A Talented Judge
muslim_school_events.1.d코0=Acquiring an education in theology and law is often a long process involving studying classical works of law, under the tutelage of the Shiekhs of various Madrasahs. For every work or commentary learnt the student acquires a certificate, an Ijaza. Depending on what Madrasha, and which Sheikh, the worth of the Ijaza may not necessarily be the same.\nA specific learned man has lately been making a very good impression in Madrasahs around the country, no doubt he has a great career as a Qadi or Mufti ahead of him.
muslim_school_events.1.a코0=I hear [mufti_province.GetAreaName] is in need of a new Qadi.
muslim_school_events.1.b코0=He will bring legal guidance to a generation as a Mufti in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].
muslim_school_events.2.t코0=The Sheik-ul-Islam
muslim_school_events.2.d코0=Where the Qadis are the judges of the land, the Muftis are the ones to provide general legal interpretation and doctrine. A [Root.GovernmentName] as large as ours, however, needs an overarching authority over all Muftis. Traditionally this is the role of the Sheik-ul-Islam.\nThe Sheik-ul-Islam will not only author Fatwas himself, he will also be the one to appoint many of the regional Muftis in our realm, and ultimately he is the person who will safeguard the legality of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s edicts. Naturally the man we pick will belong to the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] but there are a number of distinguished candidates to choose from.
muslim_school_events.2.a코0=Let us elect the foremost and most loyal Mufti to this position
muslim_school_events.2.a.tt코0=A loyal Sheik-ul-Islam will almost always take sides for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and will increase the chance of support from the religious establishment.
muslim_school_events.2.b코0=The most learned and steadfast candidate must be named Sheik-ul-Islam.
muslim_school_events.2.b.tt코0=A righteous Sheik-ul-Islam will support us as long as we maintain a pious rule. This will also make events relating to the will of our religious scholars more common.
muslim_school_events.2.c코0=A famous Sufi will give this office the dignity it deserves.
muslim_school_events.2.c.tt코0=A sufi Sheik-ul-Islam will support us as long as we support sufism in the realm. This will also make events relating to sufism more common.
muslim_school_events.3.t코0=New Madrasah
muslim_school_events.3.d코0=Prominent citizens of [madrassah_province.GetAreaName] have made a number of charitable donations for the establishment of a new Madrasah in [madrassah_province.GetCapitalName]. They have invited scholars not only from the wider [madrassah_province.GetAreaName] but also from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and even foreign theologians.
muslim_school_events.3.a코0=Wonderful.
muslim_school_events.4.t코0=Ghazis
muslim_school_events.4.d코0=For centuries, wars to expand the faith has seen groups of 'Ghazis', or holy warriors on the frontiers of Islam, raiding enemy lands and bolstering the ranks of the faithful. Our war against the infidel [infidel.GetAdjective] has attracted the attention of such warriors. They have come to join our ranks to prove their worth as holy warriors, and perhaps for the promise of loot as well.
muslim_school_events.4.a코0=They are welcome.
muslim_school_events.5.t코0=Custodianship of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]
muslim_school_events.5.d코0=With each year the holy city of [holy_city.GetCapitalName] has seen an increase in the number of pilgrims that seek the shrines there. The faithful come from all corners of the Islamic world, bringing commerce, goods, capital, news and ideas from faraway places to our ports.
muslim_school_events.5.a코0=God is Good.
muslim_school_events.6.t코0=Shiite Migration
muslim_school_events.6.d코0=While Shiism is widespread in the Islamic world, most Shiites live in lands ruled by Sunni or even non-muslim states. In order to survive, our brothers of faith often have to adopt a policy of Taqiyya, deliberately pretending to distance themselves from the Shia faith. As one of few Shia [Root.GovernmentName]s we have come to attract members of faith who no longer want to live out their spiritual lives in secrecy. Many of them are both learned and productive members of society.
muslim_school_events.6.a코0=Let us welcome them into our cities.
muslim_school_events.6.b코0=Let us send them forth to populate the frontier.
muslim_school_events.7.t코0=Sufi Syncretism
muslim_school_events.7.d코0=Sufis, with their mystical and less legalistic approach to Islam, are often more welcome among the heathen than the highly educated Ulema or soldiers of the faith. Manifesting piety in other ways such as dance, singing and by blending the Islamic traditions with local ones, the Sufis are not always at the best term with the religious establishment.\nA sufi leader has managed to get quite a following in [sufi_province.GetName], with a great number of [sufi_province.Religion.GetName] converts joining his disciples. His followers are clearing land for new settlements where they might live together and this could well lead to a much greater Islamic influence in the entire area. Many among the Ulema are asking that we send him on his way, as they fear he is leading the true faithful astray and blurring the line between Islam and the [sufi_province.Religion.GetName] faith.
muslim_school_events.7.a코0=He is doing God's work.
muslim_school_events.7.b코0=He will have to do his preaching elsewhere.
muslim_school_events.8.t코1=Foreign Theologians Enliven Scholarship
muslim_school_events.8.d코0=The theologians we invited to our country have come to greatly enrich local religious scholarship. They have left their mark upon our country and inspired a new generation of Ulema.
muslim_school_events.8.a코0=I have need of them in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].
muslim_school_events.8.b코0=They will find their places throughout our country.
muslim_school_events.9.t코0=[scholar_country.GetReligiousSchool] Theologians
muslim_school_events.9.d코0=By giving [scholar_country.GetAdjective] scholars in our Madrasahs we are not only improving the theological discussion in our country but also improving our ties with the [scholar_country.GetName] [scholar_country.GovernmentName].
muslim_school_events.9.a코0=Excellent.
muslim_school_events.10.t코0=Religious Scholars Disagree
muslim_school_events.10.d코0=Not all theologians agree. Normally this is not much of a problem, as disagreement can exist without problem in the scholarly world. Sometimes disagreements take on a more personal form however, some would argue that's how our invited scholars came to be at odds with much of our religious establishment, causing much harm to our international reputation.
muslim_school_events.10.a코0=Unfortunate.
muslim_school_events.11.t코0=Playing the Courts
muslim_school_events.11.d코0=While the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school is the officially sanctioned school of the [Root.GovernmentName] there are many courts and Qadis throughout our lands and all four of the schools of faith are deemed appropriate for civil procedures. This means that to some extent it is possible to 'play the courts' by bringing a case before a Qadi of a school considered more likely to give a beneficial ruling to a specific case.\nAn entrepreneuring merchant in [shiites_here.GetCapitalName] has become so good at this that it has angered not only the local population and his business competitors, but also the local governor. There is not much we can do about this without making inroads into the privileges of the Ulema.
muslim_school_events.11.a코0=Let us just ensure that this man is dealt with.
muslim_school_events.11.b코0=Pragmatism must come before theology.
muslim_school_events.12.t코0=Taqiyya
muslim_school_events.12.d코0=For centuries, many of the followers of Ali have considered it a necessity to hide themselves and feign adherence to other religious customs in order to keep their faith alive. Authorities in [shiites_here.GetName] have increasingly come to suspect that there is an increasing number of Shias among the local sufi lodges, and would like our blessing in their attempts to root them out.
muslim_school_events.12.a코0=We cannot tolerate heretics!
muslim_school_events.12.b코0=We must respect the Sufi lodges.
muslim_school_events.13.t코0=Protests in [protest_province.GetName]
muslim_school_events.13.d코0=As men of great spiritual strength, but also firmly part of the establishment, members of the Ulema sometimes choose to join social protests. A recent altercation between the local garrison and the urban population in [protest_province.GetName] have attracted the attention of prominent Mufti in the state of [protest_province.GetAreaName].\nOur local commander fears the situation might escalate unless we listen to the protesters, but doing so would come at a cost.
muslim_school_events.13.a코0=Let us compensate the people of [protest_province.GetName].
muslim_school_events.13.b코0=Mufti or not, there is nothing we can do.
muslim_school_events.14.t코0=The poor of [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName]
muslim_school_events.14.d코0=As cities grow, the old amenities and walls that once supported them decay. In [urbanization_province.GetCapitalName] this has over time led to change. Less clean workshops, such as those of tanners, have moved beyond the city walls, as have the cemeteries. Most visible, however, is the increasing number of poor in the streets. As existing charities have not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of the city, it has been suggested that we set aside more state property as Waqf, charitable donations for the upkeep of public soup kitchens and bath houses.
muslim_school_events.14.a코0=We will naturally support such a cause.
muslim_school_events.14.b코0=Surely local notables can afford charity out of their own pockets?
muslim_school_events.15.t코0=The City of [holy_city.GetCapitalName]
muslim_school_events.15.d코0=As Custodians of the holy mosques of [holy_city.GetCapitalName] we are responsible not only for the Holy Shrine. A state that claims this honor is also expected to fend for both the population of the holy cities, as well as the pilgrims they attract. For this purpose many rulers have devoted great resources, both within the cities themselves and large tracts of faraway farmland, in order to feed and maintain the area.\nSome say [Root.Monarch.GetName] has not been paying the attention to these cities that they deserve, that pilgrims are no longer safe and that there is great want in the streets of [holy_city.GetCapitalName].
muslim_school_events.15.a코0=Let us set aside more land for their upkeep.
muslim_school_events.15.b코0=Sadly we have no more resources to spare right now.
muslim_school_events.16.t코0=Expansion of the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah
muslim_school_events.16.d코0=The Madrasah of [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] has been gaining repute, not only as a center of [Root.GetReligiousSchool] learning, but also for its Shiekhs from other schools. [Root.GetReligiousScholars] scholars from other parts of the world have in particular made a name for themselves at the [madrasa_province.GetCapitalName] Madrasah and as a result both the institution itself, the adjoining market district and the bustling city as a whole is growing rapidly.\nUrban growth is never without its problems, however, and a growing Madrasah still needs to be provided for. If the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] would set aside a larger charitable donation for the upkeep and maintenance of a greater Madrasah it would benefit both the city and the area at large.
muslim_school_events.16.a코0=We must contribute to this endeavor.
muslim_school_events.16.b코0=The locals can feed and pay for them.
muslim_school_events.17.t코0=Dargah
muslim_school_events.17.d코0=A Sufi Sheikh has passed away in [dargah_province.GetName] and his followers are now putting up a shrine in his honor. Pilgrims from various parts of the country are already starting to come to the province to see the shrine of this great man, some calling him a saint. Local notables have set aside a charitable donation its maintenance and his former pupils have opened a lodge nearby.\nWhile there is nothing wrong with honoring a great man, some more traditionalist among the pious and the Ulema feel that this form or worship is sacrilegious.\n Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] pay the shrine in [dargah_province.GetName] a visit it might do much, both for the prestige of the shrine itself but also for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] popular perception.
muslim_school_events.17.a코0=Let us seek guidance at this holy place.
muslim_school_events.17.b코0=We must not feed into local superstition.
muslim_school_events.18.t코0=Alevis of [alevi_province.GetName]
muslim_school_events.18.d코0=While they are not our direct brothers of faith, a great number among the Turkic tribesmen in Anatolia are Shia Alevis. Like the Jafari's the Alevis are twelvers and believe in the coming of the Twelve Imam. Their faith is also quite deeply entrenched in mysticism and Sufism. Under Sunni rule they have been forced to live a life in many ways secluded from society, they have not been allowed to intermarry the Sunnis and they have been distrusted by the state.\nMany among the people of [alevi_province.GetName] are Alevis and they have generally welcomed us as their new overlords. Their mystical traditions are in many ways different from ours but if we embraced these people we could likely spread the Shia faith much more quickly in the area.
muslim_school_events.18.a코0=Let us empower our brothers of faith in the area.
muslim_school_events.18.b코0=While we welcome them, administration will remain in the hands of local authorities.
muslim_school_events.19.t코0=The Worldly Ulema
muslim_school_events.19.d코0=Not all members of the Ulema are great theologians or intellectuals. Corruption can grow in any corner of the state and for some it can be hard to tell apart what benefits the faith and what might benefit themselves. It has come to the attention of [Root.Monarch.GetName] that a number of pious grants that exist around the empire have been obtained through fraud or illegally passed on to heirs. Our wazir has suggested that we inspect and verify all such grants in the [Root.GovernmentName], especially in regions that were not originally ruled by us.\nThis would clearly be a grave affront to the Ulema, however, who would see it as an encroachment on their privileges and an attack on their caste as a whole.
muslim_school_events.19.a코0=A few transgressions are nothing compared to what these men give us.
muslim_school_events.19.b코0=Only traitors have anything to fear.
muslim_school_events.20.t코0=The Maddhab of [Root.GetName]
muslim_school_events.20.d코0=As a young country we are not yet patronizing any particular religious school. While there are many ways to follow God we should have a specific guiding doctrine for our rulers to follow.
muslim_school_events.20.a코0=Ok.
muslim_school_events.20.b코0=Let us follow the school of Abu Hanifa.
muslim_school_events.20.c코0=There is only the way of the Hanbalis.
muslim_school_events.20.dd코0=Malik ibn Anas has shown the right way.
muslim_school_events.20.e코0=Imam al-Shafi'i's teachings are the most relevant.
muslim_school_events.20.f코0=The Jafari school will last us until the arrival of the Madhi.
muslim_school_events.20.g코0=Ismail ibn Jafar and his followers will be our guides.
muslim_school_events.20.h코0=Let us never hide our principles! We must follow Zaid ibn Ali's teachings.
muslim_school_events.21.t코0=Neo Sufism & Traditionalist Reaction
muslim_school_events.21.d코0=Many among the Ulema are increasingly unhappy with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Among pious Muslims, our inclusion of heathens in high offices as well as the adoption of heathen customs and traditions, is viewed with scorn. The intrusions of the state on interpretation of law and other traditional domains of the Ulema have also not earned the state any friends among the jurists of the realm.\nCharismatic Shiekhs of the Sufi Naqshbandi order have begun to agitate against the state what they consider a wrongful, and in some cases sinful implementation of Islamic law in our realm.
muslim_school_events.21.a코0=They are sadly misguided.
muslim_school_events.21.a.tt코0=From now on the religious establishment will react more strongly to impious conduct of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].
muslim_school_events.21.a.ttb코0=The §YUlema§! will now expect to be granted more land.
muslim_school_events.22.t코0=Wahabism
muslim_school_events.22.d코0=A growing movement among the Hanbali Ulema of the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] is advocating a return to a purer faith. They strongly oppose any innovations to the prophets customs, and anything that is not part of the literary sources of Islamic Law. Strongly opposing all forms of Sufism, saint worship or Non-Islamic traditions they promise to bring a truer religious society to all who embrace their teachings.
muslim_school_events.22.a코0=Interesting.
muslim_school_events.22.a.tt코0=It is now be possible for Tribal Federations to change school to Hanbali.
muslim_school_events.23.t코0=Sufi Shrines
muslim_school_events.23.d코0=The practice to patronize or even provide for shrines connected to the tombs of famous Sufis has long been a major point of contention for the Ulema. With a more traditionalist generation taking power they are now placing pressure on our ruler to try to clamp down on this custom.
muslim_school_events.23.a코0=We must do as they ask.
muslim_school_events.23.b코0=No. The old masters were great men!
EST_VAL_NEO_SUFISM코1=Neo Sufism & Traditionalism: §Y$VAL$%§!
compile_x_fiqh_title코0=Compile the [Root.GetReligiousSchool] Fiqh
compile_x_fiqh_desc코0=It is not always clear, even to the most well-read of the Ulema, how to best apply the Sharia and over the centuries a large number of contradictory rulings have come to exist in some areas. If we spent considerable time and effort to allow the best minds of the realm to compile and write a comprehensive review of [Root.GetReligiousSchool] Fiqh, this would likely be be an immense aid to all Qadis and Muftis in our realm.
compile_x_fiqh_tooltip_part1코0=The compilation of the Fatawah-i [Root.Monarch.GetName]i will take many years, during which time the below modifier is active:

trade_policy_events.1.t코0=Foreign Quarter of [quarter_city.GetCapitalName]
trade_policy_events.1.d코0=For a long time foreign merchants have been settling in [quarter_city.GetCapitalName] to better conduct trade with our country. Lately, however, with the intensified activity of the [community_country.GovernmentName] of [community_country.GetDefiniteArticleBeforePluralCountry][community_country.GetName] the quarter has grown into a city of its own.\nThis is not without its problems, our own citizens are complaining that the [community_country.GetAdjective] community is growing at their expense. They demand that we impose harsher rules on foreign merchants and curtail their activities outside of the foreign quarter.
trade_policy_events.1.a코0=No, we should encourage the foreign community to grow instead.
trade_policy_events.1.b코0=We must respect the wishes of the good men of [quarter_city.GetCapitalName].
trade_policy_events.2.t코0=[trade_province.Culture.GetName] [trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood]
trade_policy_events.2.d코0=Due to the long time that many of our merchant families are spending in [trade_province.Culture.GetName] communities and especially among the people of [trade_province.GetAreaName] they have begun to take to the local specialties. Some have begun to market [trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] from the area in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] at very high prices.\nThis is an enterprise that is rapidly making both them and the locals very rich...
trade_policy_events.2.a코0=A great example of private enterprise.
trade_policy_events.2.b코0=Beware, for fashion is fickle.
trade_policy_events.3.t코0=[From.GetAdjective] Demand and [Root.GetAdjective] Supply
trade_policy_events.3.d코0=It seems the [trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] of [trade_province.GetName] have become increasingly sought after in the [From.GetAdjective] capital, [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. There was always a high demand for our goods but this exceptional pull has resulted in a great surge of wealth in the province.
trade_policy_events.3.a코0=Excellent.
trade_policy_events.4.t코0=The Value of a Good Map
trade_policy_events.4.d코0=It seems the merchants of [spy_country.GetName] have been doing a lot more than just trading. In a routine check our local representatives managed to uncover not only a large selection of contraband, but also a set of very detailed maps over our land. So detailed in fact that they are in many cases better than our own. It seems the merchant was not only a spy but also quite good at finding business opportunities.
trade_policy_events.4.a코0=We will make good use of his information.
trade_policy_events.5.t코0=Bandits in [banditprovince.GetName]
trade_policy_events.5.d코0=A young [Root.GetAdjective] Merchant that had been sent to [banditprovince.GetName] with the mission to not only trade but also to map military installations and valuable resources has hit a bit of a snag. The issue is not, as could be expected, the local authorities. Rather the area is plagued by bandits and deserters from the local garrison.\nOur agent has now sent for help from us to clear the area of the worst excesses so that it can be properly mapped and analyzed.
trade_policy_events.5.a코0=We will divert the necessary resources.
trade_policy_events.5.b코0=No, we would just be aiding the [banditprovince_owner.GetAdjective].
trade_policy_events.6.t코0=Foreign Traders Intervene in Local Affairs
trade_policy_events.6.d코0=Local bandits has long been a problem in [banditprovince.GetName] but it seems the matter has finally been resolved. Rather than local authorities dealing with the problem, however, it seems that it was the [From.GetAdjective] merchant community that stepped in to deal with the problem, paying for it from their own pockets.
trade_policy_events.6.a코0=Marvellous
trade_policy_events.7.t코0=Profiteering in [trade_province.GetCapitalName]
trade_policy_events.7.d코0=The citizens of [trade_province.GetCapitalName] have grown tired of the local influence of greedy [trader_country.GetAdjective] merchants that they claim are using unfair advantages to out-compete local businesses. They demand that we step in to limit the influence of foreign traders on the area and reaffirm the privileges of our own merchants and artisans.\nIf we do not act they might take matters in their own hands...
trade_policy_events.7.a코0=We must protect our trade.
trade_policy_events.7.b코0=Competition is good for everyone.
trade_policy_events.8.t코0=Growth of the Business of [developing_business_province.GetFancyTradeGood]
trade_policy_events.8.d코0=Our efforts to maximize trading profits in the area of [developing_business_province.GetAreaName] has born fruit in the province of [developing_business_province.GetName]. Entrepreneurs have managed to greatly increase the output of [developing_business_province.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] and have found new markets in our capital for the processed goods.
trade_policy_events.8.a코0=Excellent
trade_policy_events.9.t코1=[Root.prominent_merchant.GetName] and his Family
trade_policy_events.9.d코0=A merchant family from [merchant_family_province.GetName] has come to greatly expand our long range trade with [foreign_province_owner.GetName]. By successfully establishing themselves in both [foreign_province_owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] and the [foreign_province_owner.GetAdjective] hinterlands they have come to be very influential in both our societies, and very rich. This is a situation we could probably make use of…
trade_policy_events.9.a코0=Let us use their influence to extract maps of [foreign_province_owner.GetAdjective] hinterlands.
trade_policy_events.9.b코0=We should not ask what they can do for us. What is good for them is good for us.
trade_policy_events.9.c코0=Let us make [Root.prominent_merchant.GetName] a the new architect for our trade policies.
trade_policy_events.10.t코0=Increased Demand for [trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood]
trade_policy_events.10.d코1=[trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood] from [trade_province.GetName] fetch a very good price in foreign as well as domestic markets lately. So much so that it has given rise to a new generation of entrepreneurs and economic speculation.

trade_policy_events.11.d코0=[trade_province.GetName] has long lived of off the locally produced [trade_province.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] but lately they have been forced to sell their products at reduced prices.

trade_policy_events.12.t코0=Spread of Ideas
trade_policy_events.12.d코0=With the exchange of money and trade goods there is often a spread of methods and ideas.

propagate_religion_events.1.t코0=Traders in [trade_province.GetCapitalName]
propagate_religion_events.1.d코0=Muslim traders have been an increasingly common sight in our ports for generations now and we have grown used to them and their religion. In our ports in the [trade_province.GetName] province, and especially [trade_province.GetCapitalName] itself these merchants have become so commonplace that they are now an integral part of the urban population.\nRecently some of these traders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], asking to be allowed to build a settlement of their own, just outside [trade_province.GetCapitalName] proper.
propagate_religion_events.1.a코0=Only good can come from this.
propagate_religion_events.1.b코0=No, they must remain where we can control them.
propagate_religion_events.2.t코0=[converter_country.Religion.GetName] Missionaries
propagate_religion_events.2.d코0=A group of Muslim missionaries have settled down in [trade_province.GetName] to found a new community there for themselves and their converts. They are cooperating with local authorities and do not oppose our rule, but their presence will likely lead to their religion spreading more quickly into the entire area.
propagate_religion_events.2.a코0=We cannot let authority slip to outside groups such as this one.
propagate_religion_events.2.b코0=They will be a welcome addition to our society.
propagate_religion_events.3.t코0=Muslim Sailors
propagate_religion_events.3.d코0=From the Yellow sea to the Indian Ocean there’s an abundance of ships, from small dhows to great galleys, constantly sailing between the many ports. Taken together this trade network provides goods and supplies for more than half of the world's population.\nWhat many of these galleys have in common is that they are manned by Muslim sailors. These are sailors from Africa or the Middle East joined by converted locals.
propagate_religion_events.3.a코0=Let us encourage these sailors to seek out our ports!
propagate_religion_events.3.b코1=We have no need of foreign faiths on our ships.

propagate_religion_events.4.a코0=This is a good sign.
propagate_religion_events.4.b코0=Let us invite this man to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], where he can be put to good use.
propagate_religion_events.5.t코0=Mosque built in [mosque_province.GetName]
propagate_religion_events.5.d코0=The Muslims of [mosque_province.GetName] have constructed a new Mosque to serve as their house of worship. The Mosque is the new clear center of the community and will likely attract greater numbers to settle here. It will also facilitate local conversion of the entire area.\nThere is clear indication that the new Mosque is in part being funded by the many [converter_country.GetAdjective] traders active in the region, and in our government some worry that this might lead to undue influence for them and their religion.
propagate_religion_events.5.a코0=We cannot allow this.
propagate_religion_events.5.b코0=Let us provide them with the support they need to build a better community.
propagate_religion_events.6.t코0=Sultan of [Root.GetName]?
propagate_religion_events.6.d코0=With Islam increasingly becoming the dominant religion of our country many of our government officials, nobles and other notables, have begun to adopt Islamic notions of kingship, Arabic names and titles. Many have in fact started to refer to [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a Sultan, even though our official state religion is still [Root.Religion.GetName]. Some advisors of [Root.Monarch.GetName] now suggest that it might be prudent to go along with this. If we start referring to our own country as a sultanate, it might easen relations with the many Muslim countries around the world.
propagate_religion_events.6.a코0=I like the idea.
propagate_religion_events.6.b코0=No, we must defend the traditional values of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName]!
propagate_religion_events.7.t코0=Joining the Community of the Faithful
propagate_religion_events.7.d코0=As [Root.Religion.GetName] is now the official religion of [Root.GetName] we have joined the community of the Faithful.

propagate_religion_events.8.t코0=Traveling Scholar
propagate_religion_events.8.d코0=A learned man from a faraway land has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].

propagate_religion_events.8.a코0=We have use of this man. Let us offer him a place at our court!
propagate_religion_events.8.b코0=Let us learn as much as we can about the state of things abroad.
propagate_religion_events.9.t코0=Muslim Chiefs
propagate_religion_events.9.d코0=In the [Root.GetAdjective] hinterlands many chiefs rule their own little domains with little interference from central rule. However, even though they lack the ability to project much power some do have greater ambitions. Some local chiefs in [hinterland_province.GetName] have given name to greater pretensions by starting to style themselves sultans and trying to claim legitimacy by converting their population to Islam.
propagate_religion_events.9.a코0=Ridiculous.
propagate_religion_events.10.t코0=Islamic Syncretism
propagate_religion_events.10.d코0=An increasingly common sight in the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside is that of traveling Sufis, mystic missionaries of the Islamic faith. They are often warmly received not only by their brothers in faith, but also by the rural population who have found a way to integrate the Islamic creed into their own traditions and myths. The result is not something that would fit in Mecca or Cairo but has made many more predisposed towards Islam in general.
propagate_religion_events.10.a코0=We must protect the faith of our ancestors!
propagate_religion_events.10.b코0=What harm can these men do.
propagate_religion_events.11.t코0=Muslim Refugees
propagate_religion_events.11.d코0=A number of refugees from a distant war has arrived on our coasts. They are led by Islamic sheikhs and claim that if we just allow them some unclaimed land they will create a prospering settlement for themselves and lead productive lives as our subjects.

tribal_federation_events.1.d코0=The [clan_province.GetName] clans have long supported the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they are a pillar of our federation.

tribal_federation_events.1.a코0=It is time that we show our gratitude.
tribal_federation_events.1.b코0=Favors have to be earned.
tribal_federation_events.2.t코0=Plight of the citizens of [urban_province.GetCapitalName]
tribal_federation_events.2.d코1=The city council of [urban_province.GetCapitalName] have approached us asking for our help. They claim that the clansmen have been placing undue tax burdens on them, as well as taking an unreasonable amount of their land for grazing. They now reach out to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] hoping to be given a more fair treatment.
tribal_federation_events.2.a코0=We will not interfere in local politics.
tribal_federation_events.2.b코0=Let us restrain the Clan Leaders.
tribal_federation_events.3.t코0=Rising Clan Leader
tribal_federation_events.3.d코0=The power balance in our federation frequently shifts as able individuals and clans prove themselves and gain influence through their courage and cunning in war or raiding. The area of [clan_area.GetAreaName] has recently seen the rise of one such new clan, with its leader now demanding a place on the council of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

tribal_federation_events.3.c코0=We must protect the privileges of the traditional leading clans.
tribal_federation_events.4.t코0=Influential Sheikh
tribal_federation_events.4.d코0=A local Sufi order in [sufi_came_from_here.GetName] has come to gain great popularity among the local tribesmen. This newfound fervor has lead to a growing sense of unity and fervor among our warriors in the area, who are greatly taken in by this charismatic mysticism.
tribal_federation_events.4.a코0=Let us invite him to the council of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!
tribal_federation_events.4.b코0=This is an affront to all that is proper.
tribal_federation_events.5.t코0=Religious Fervor
tribal_federation_events.5.d코0=The tribes of [tribal_religion_province.GetName] have been enamored by the charismatic preachers of the [neighboring_feudal_theocracy.GovernmentName] of [neighboring_feudal_theocracy.GetName]. As many parts of our federation this area was always religiously heterogeneous, but this turn of events worry the council of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

tribal_federation_events.6.d코0=Traditionally when integrating new lands the right to tax certain areas or use their pastures for grazing is divided among those of our leading clans who helped during recent wars.

The other has a strong local presence but is otherwise without much influence and power in our federation.
tribal_federation_events.6.a코0=Let us trust the local abilities.

tribal_federation_events.7.t코0=The Royal Family
tribal_federation_events.7.d코0=From the highest to the lowest parts of [Root.GetAdjective] society, personal authority is paramount to any form of power.

tribal_federation_events.8.d코0=A caravan carrying [fancy_trade_caravan_origin.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] has been ambushed by tribes in [ambush_province.GetName]. It appears a local clan feels their lawful tax collection on our behalf is not enough to survive on. Instead they have taken it upon themselves to increase their income through violent means.\nThe royal council is divided among those who feel we must strike down on the bandits to ensure safe passage for the traders, and those who feel we should start paying these tribesmen to protect the caravans.
tribal_federation_events.8.a코0=We must root out the raiders.

tribal_federation_events.9.t코0=Stolen [fancy_trade_caravan_origin.GetFancyTradeGood]

A caravan carrying [fancy_trade_caravan_origin.GetFancyTradeGood_LOW] has been ambushed by tribes in [ambush_province.GetName]. The local authorities claim that they are going to handle the situation, but for now the effect has been a sharp decrease in profit for our local traders.
tribal_federation_events.9.a코0=Outrageous!
tribal_federation_events.10.t코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Honor Guard
tribal_federation_events.10.d코0=There are many informal ways for the clans in our federation to show their influence. A position in the royal council is certainly one, as is command of armies or the right to tax specific provinces. One of the foremost honors a clan can be bestowed however is a position on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s honor guard. Any influential clan would be expected to have representatives among the rulers personal kawass but there is only need of so many guards for one man. In some ways this is an idea at odds with the goal of actually protecting the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].
tribal_federation_events.10.a코0=Let us expand the honor guard.
tribal_federation_events.10.b코0=We need men of ability, not more meaningless ceremony.
tribal_federation_events.11.t코0=The Tribes of [Root.GetName]
tribal_federation_events.11.d코0=The local tribes of [Root.GetName] are impressed by our advancing armies and have approached us asking to join our federation directly. In exchange they ask that their old privileges be respected and that they’re given an equal standing to other tribes in the area under our control.\nHowever, the tribal council might take issue with their own influence being diluted, if we should agree.
tribal_federation_events.11.a코0=Let us welcome them to the family.

tarh코0=Tarh
desc_tarh코0=We are forcing the people of this province to buy local products, and to pay a price we have set. This has ensured that we are not losing money directly on our royal monopolies but it has also resulted in a general drop of productivity and quality.
unprofitable_monopolies코0=Unprofitable Monopolies
desc_unprofitable_monopolies코0=The production in this province is controlled through royal monopolies, but the demand for the goods being produced has gone down significantly lately, resulting in a loss of profit for us.

mamluk_amir_al_hajj코0=Mamluk Amir al-Hajj
desc_mamluk_amir_al_hajj코0=We have given one of our most trusted Mamluks the task of guarding the caravans to the holy cities. As there are no warriors as skilled as our own kind the caravans should be safe. Even if he lacks knowledge of the local landscape and population.
diplomat_amir_al_hajj코0=Diplomatic Amir al-Hajj
desc_diplomat_amir_al_hajj코0=Our Amir al-Hajj, the official in charge of the yearly pilgrimages to Mecca, has been chosen from among our best diplomats. This should make him well suited for leading the vital caravans through sometimes dangerous territories.

desc_bedouin_amir_al_hajj코0=Our Amir al-Hajj, the official in charge of the yearly pilgrimages to Mecca, has been chosen among the Bedouin tribesmen who would normally pose a threat to the very caravans we would have him protect. This should make him uniquely well suited to protect the caravans, but can also be seen as a neglect of our sacred duty by some.
awlad_al_nas_commander코0=Commander from the Awlad al-nas

loyal_mamluks_in_high_positions코0=Loyal Mamluks
desc_loyal_mamluks_in_high_positions코0=We have replaced the Mamluks put in power by our predecessors with loyal freshly bought Mamluks. This has earned us few friends among the households of Cairo but at least we know that we can trust our officers now.
mamluk_events.0.t코0=Mamluk Succession
mamluk_events.0.d코0=The death of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has left our country without a ruler. All the important Mamluk households of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are calling upon their influence to have a say in who his successor is going to be. Depending on who wins our new ruler will have the support of different households and different parts of the country.\nOnly one thing is certain, those that would rather have seen their own group's interests prevailing will not greet our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with joy. Some might even spend the rest of their lives trying to limit his influence.
mamluk_events.0.a코0=We need the support of the [first_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] Mamluks.
mamluk_events.0.b코0=Only the [second_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] Mamluks are of use now.
mamluk_events.0.c코0=The [third_ruler_alternative_province.Culture.GetName] candidate has our support!
mamluk_events.0.dd코0=The best alternative is one who has no ties to the groups in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]...
mamluk_events.1.t코0=[not_ruling_culture_province.Culture.GetName] Soldiers
mamluk_events.1.d코1=While Mamluks make up the core of our forces not all of our military might consists of warrior slaves. Local [not_ruling_culture_province.Culture.GetName] soldiers make up much of our infantry and they are also used for guard and garrison duties.\nSmall chances of advancement and low pay aren’t the best motivators however and it is not clear how far we can trust these men. Certainly their training and equipment are often neglected by the Amir in charge of them.\nIn [not_ruling_culture_province.GetAreaName] the mistrust between the [not_ruling_culture_province.Culture.GetName] and Mamluk Amirs have led to a mutiny.
mamluk_events.1.a코0=We must crush this in its cradle!
mamluk_events.1.b코0=Let us see what we can do to improve their situation.
mamluk_events.2.t코0=The Tarh and the Royal Monopolies
mamluk_events.2.d코0=Our predecessors have wisely used a system of royal monopolies to control the revenue from cash crops and fine goods. With demand falling however we are losing money on these investments. Our overseer in [monopoly_province.GetName] is reporting that they have been unable to sell their stock for two years now and worry that this is going to cost the state money.\nHe suggests that we force our subjects to buy these goods at a set price instead so that we can regain our investment. A process traditionally known as Tarh.
mamluk_events.2.a코0=What an excellent idea!
mamluk_events.2.b코0=We will just have to endure the cost.
mamluk_events.3.t코0=Revolt of [mamluk_province.Culture.GetName] Amir
mamluk_events.3.d코0=One of our more powerful Mamluk Amirs has built up a powerbase in [mamluk_province.GetAreaName] and is now marching on [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. There is rumors of widespread support for his cause among the Mamluk households of the capital and even within the citadel itself.
mamluk_events.3.a코0=The penalty for treason is death!
mamluk_events.4.t코0=Factionalism
mamluk_events.4.d코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is far from the only owner of Mamluks in our [Root.GovernmentName]. The households of influential manumitted Mamluks often contain great, if not greater, numbers of newly imported slaves from their home regions. These influential Amirs are often those with the greatest influence during a succession but even when the throne is occupied the influence of the Mamluk households are great on [Root.GetAdjective] politics. It is up to [Root.Monarch.GetName] to ensure that this factionalism does not stifle the politics of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].
mamluk_events.4.a코0=We must attempt to play them off against each other.
mamluk_events.4.b코0=Let us pick sides and support the stronger factions.
mamluk_events.5.t코0=Palace Coup
mamluk_events.5.d코0=Gravely discontent with the misrule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], prominent Mamluk Amirs have taken it upon themselves to depose our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and put a more able warrior on the throne.
mamluk_events.5.a코0=We will not abandon [Root.Monarch.GetName]!
mamluk_events.5.b코0=All men must die.
mamluk_events.6.t코0=The City of Cairo
mamluk_events.6.d코0=Much older than our own [Root.GovernmentName], Cairo has been embellished by rulers and conquerors for hundreds if not a thousand years. Bringing order in this maze of buildings, from the tombs of the city of the dead and the slums of fustat, to the bustling markets of Khan el-Khalili, or the great Citadel of Cairo itself, has proven a monumental task for many of our predecessors. Nonetheless, as the master of the city, [Root.Monarch.GetName], is expected to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mark upon Cairo, both to embellish and develop it, and to combat disease and keep the order.
mamluk_events.6.a코0=Let us renovate the souks and the Khan el-Khalili.
mamluk_events.6.b코0=We must renovate the growing slums and the suburbs.
mamluk_events.6.c코0=The Mosques and the al-Azhar require our attention.
mamluk_events.6.dd코0=Let us focus on the citadel itself, and the defenses of the city.
mamluk_events.6.e코0=Coming generations shall envy the monuments we erect.
mamluk_events.6.f코0=There is not much we can do for the citizens of Cairo right now.
mamluk_events.7.t코0=A New Amir al-Hajj
mamluk_events.7.d코0=The pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina is one that every Muslim should undertake at least once in their lifetime. As the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is our responsibility to ensure that they can safely reach that destination. This is a position that in many ways requires both cunning and martial ability, as the way to proceed can range from defeating raiders to negotiating passage from local rulers, to outright threats or bribery. The Amir al-Hajj will have the overall responsibility for the Hajj caravans and will have great freedom in how to achieve a steady and peaceful passage for all [Root.GetAdjective] pilgrims.
mamluk_events.7.a코0=Let us choose a Bedouin, the best of our own.
mamluk_events.7.a.tt코0=Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Bedouin Amir al-Hajj will be able to protect the caravans from dangers that none of the other options could.
mamluk_events.7.b코0=Let us choose a Bedouin, native to the deserts of Arabia.
mamluk_events.7.c코0=A skilled warrior will be up for the task.
mamluk_events.7.c.tt코0=Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Warrior Amir al-Hajj will have a good chance of defending the caravan if it is attacked, but he may also create unnecessary conflicts through his lack of tact.
mamluk_events.7.dd코0=An able diplomat will handle this best.
mamluk_events.7.dd.tt코0=Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Diplomat Amir al-Hajj will be more efficient when your country is at peace, and less so when you are at war.
mamluk_events.7.e코0=Only a loyal Mamluk can perform this task.
mamluk_events.7.e.tt코0=Your choice of §YAmir al-Hajj§! will have an effect both on the success rate of the Hajj Caravans of your people as well as the type of impact any problems with the Hajj will have:\nA Mamluk Amir al-Hajj will be more trustworthy when your ruler has high legitimacy, and much less trustworthy when legitimacy is low.
mamluk_events.8.t코0=Hajj Caravans Raided
mamluk_events.8.d코0=A recent caravan of pilgrims for the holy cities was ambushed and plundered. It is our duty to protect those among our subjects who would set out for the holy cities and now our ability to do so is put in question.
mamluk_events.8.a코0=This will not happen again.
mamluk_events.8.b코0=We must spend more to protect them.
mamluk_events.8.c코0=Our Amir al-Hajj will use his contacts to ensure a better outcome in the future.
mamluk_events.9.t코0=The Pilgrims are Safe
mamluk_events.9.d코0=Our efforts to protect those of our subjects who seek to perform their pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have paid off. It is now long since there was last a raid and the realm is at peace.
mamluk_events.9.a코0=Excellent.
mamluk_events.10.t코0=Awlad al-nas
mamluk_events.10.d코0=Having been educated to be loyal warriors since early age Mamluk slaves often have the complete trust of their owner or employer. Their sons however, the Awlad al-nas, having grown up under far more convenient and forgiving circumstances, are generally considered far less able and loyal. Unable to serve as Royal Mamluks the Awlad al-nas instead constitute a social elite within regular military units and in the lower administration.\nThese noble sons themselves are however continually trying to prove that they are ready for bigger responsibilities. With the open position of command for the defenses of the [defence_province.GetAreaName] state, a number of them are hoping that we will entrust them with this task.
mamluk_events.10.a코0=Let us appoint one of the sons.
mamluk_events.10.b코0=We can only trust our own, the commander must be a Mamluk.
mamluk_events.11.t코0=Qaranis
mamluk_events.11.d코0=This [Root.GovernmentName] was founded by Mamluk slaves and the ownership and import of skilled warrior slaves remain the base for any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s power. It is only natural that a slave will be more loyal to his master than any other in his new homeland, and even more so if rewarded by manumission for services rendered.\nHowever, currently many of the royal Mamluks in our administration, court and armies are those that $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ bought and introduced to our [Root.GovernmentName]. These are men with great influence but no personal loyalties to [Root.Monarch.GetName], men that our new Mamluks accuse of plotting and trying to limit their influence.
mamluk_events.11.a코0=Let us root out the Qaranis from important positions!
mamluk_events.11.b코0=We have no choice but to trust them, we are all Mamluks after all...
mamluk_events.12.t코0=Furusiyya
mamluk_events.12.d코0=The Furusiyya are a set of equestrian exercises that teach young warriors the craft of cavalry warfare. With detailed rules, training manuals and very popular public competitions and champions, the Furusiyya has in many ways been perfected by Mamluk warrior aristocracy. While some chroniclers would claim that the champions of today could never compete with the warriors of the past, it is still both customary, and very popular, for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s to arrange big public Furusiyya competitions, and the champions remain the heroes of many popular tales.
mamluk_events.12.a코0=This is good for the people, but not something for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to spend money on.
mamluk_events.12.b코0=Let us expand and build new hippodromes to patronize the flowers of chivalry.
furusiyya코0=Furusiyya
desc_furusiyya코0=We are spending considerable resources on upholding the great traditions of martial competitions for cavalry in the Mamluk state.
